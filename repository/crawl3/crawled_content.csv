Three days after losing to the Suns at home the Warriors pulled out the win without Kevin Durant who missed the game with a sore ankle and avoided being swept in the season series. Golden State was led by Klay Thompson's 30 points on 5-for-10 3-point shooting and received a huge game from DeMarcus Counsins who finished with 27 points eight rebounds and seven assists in 27 minutes. Stephen Curry added 24 points for the Warriors while the Rockets were paced by James Harden's 29 and Chris Paul's 24. Here are some takeaways from the game. Cousins had a phenomenal overall game but what stood out -- particularly early -- was his passing. The mountainous center used his eagle eyes and deft touch to deliver beautiful passes all night long finding cutters and shooters alike. Without Durant the Warriors needed another prominent half-court facilitator and Cousins fit the bill to a tee. starting it off ‚úåÔ∏èüì∫@NBCSAuthentic & @espn pic.twitter.com/iZ2pE9Qc02 In last year's playoffs and in wins earlier this season the Rockets' switch-heavy defense gave the Warriors fits. It's harder for them to do that with a threat like Cousins on the floor and Houston had trouble finding a way to defend him. Clint Capela played 20 minutes in the first half since Nene is pretty much out of the rotation and Kenneth Faried can't handle a skilled center of Cousins' size. If these teams do end up meeting in the postseason it will be interesting to see how the Rockets deal with Boogie moving forward. ""It was a good matchup out there for him"" Thompson said of Cousins after the game. ""He's so good at using his size against longer defenders. He just played probably the most complete game he's played since he's been here. I mean I was getting wide-open looks from his passing ability and he adds a whole new dimension to our team so you saw what he can do with us tonight."" Before the game Curry said the Warriors had a chance to ""send a statement"" against the Rockets. Just as they have since last year's playoffs the Warriors got up for the big game and reminded everyone just how good they can be -- even without Durant. The Warriors have seemingly been complacent for a good part of the season yet still hold the No. 1 seed in the West and appear to rise to the challenge whenever they decide to up the effort. Whether they can do it in the playoffs will be a different story. After missing two games with a sore knee Thompson has been on an absolute tear. He came into Wednesday having scored 39 and 28 points respectively in his last two games and kept the heat check going on Wednesday. Thompson worked off screens and pulled up for transition 3s extending the Rockets defense and opening up the lane for Cousins and slashers. ‚òîÔ∏è @KlayThompson puts up 30 PTS (5 3PM) in the @warriors victory and becomes the second player in @NBAHistory with 200 3PM in seven consecutive seasons joining @StephenCurry30! #DubNation pic.twitter.com/j3HgIBKDFy It wasn't quite as bad as Game 7 of last year's Western Conference finals but the Rockets' 3-point well ran dry again on Wednesday. They knocked down just 11 of 41 3-point attempts with Harden Paul and PJ Tucker combining to go just 5-for-25. As usual Houston leads the league in 3-pointers made per game but they just couldn't find the range against the Warriors. Despite that they managed to claw their way back into the game at the end but it was too little too late. Steve Kerr has said for the past few weeks that it's time for Golden State to up its defensive intensity as they prepare for the postseason and they certainly did it on Wednesday. Various Warriors did a solid job handling Harden's isolations and the hustle was definitely there when getting out on shooters. As potent as Golden State's offense has been their defense has been just as stout during their mini-dynasty. It seems like they still have the ability to get to that level based on Wednesday night's win.

https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/,"Play Now BRACKET GAMES Play Now FANTASY BASEBALL Listen Live Busts Gant who is one of the leading candidates for the Cardinals' final rotation spot is slated to throw two innings in an intrasquad game Thursday morning Jenifer Langosch of MLB.com reports. Gant just pitched a clean eighth inning Tuesday versus the Braves and he'll get another opportunity to make his case for a rotation spot just 48 hours later. The right-hander is primarily battling Dakota Hudson who allowed an earned run over three innings versus the Marlins on Wednesday for the job. While Hudson has been impressive thus far this spring Gant has kept himself in contention by generating a 4.00 ERA over nine innings across four spring appearances (two starts). Fowler has hit second in eight of the last 10 spring games but manager Mike Shildt maintains he's still undecided about who'll open the regular season in that role Jenifer Langosch of MLB.com reports. ""We're still in a situation where it makes sense for Dexter to get his at-bats at the top of the order see what that looks like"" Shildt said hours before Fowler went 0-for-2 with a walk. ""It's a combination. We like him there. And also we'll still look at some other lineups as we get closer [to Opening Day]."" The Cardinals are looking to put Fowler in the best possible situation to succeed following a 2018 campaign in which the veteran outfielder slashed .180/.278/.298 over 334 plate appearances in the second year of a five-year $82.5 million contract. Fowler has yet to provide much reason for optimism this spring hitting .185 with no home runs and one RBI over 27 spring at-bats. However a spot near the top of the order in the regular season -- where he would be presumably surrounded by the likes of Matt Carpenter and Paul Goldschmidt -- would give Fowler a solid chance at both RBI and run-scoring opportunities. Hudson threw 69 pitches over just three innings in his latest Grapefruit League start against the Marlins on Wednesday Jenifer Langosch of MLB.com reports. Hudson got 44 of those offerings into the strike zone and limited damage allowing just an earned run on two hits and three walks across three innings while recording three strikeouts. The trio of free passes were the first Hudson has issued this spring as he continues to battle for the Cardinals' one open rotation spot. Hudson's primary competition for the job is John Gant who's slated to pitch in an intrasquad game Thursday morning after having appeared in relief Tuesday. Strickland (back) threw well in Wednesday's intrasquad game and will be available to pitch in the season-opening series against the Athletics in Japan Greg Johns of MLB.com reports. Strickland hasn't seen Cactus League action since March 3 due to back soreness but Wednesday's showing was sufficient for manager Scott Servais to confirm the projected closer's availability for the start of the regular season. Strickland is slated to tune up for that first series by pitching in one of the exhibition games Seattle will play against the Yomiuri Giants on March 17 and 18. Bishop will be included on the team's roster for the season-opening series against the Athletics in Japan Greg Johns of MLB.com reports. Bishop has never played about the Double-A level and saw his 2018 season cut short by a broken forearm but the combination of a strong spring and Mallex Smith's ongoing absence due to an elbow injury have afforded him a spot on the initial version of the regular-season roster. Mitch Haniger is slated to play center field in Smith's absence and Bishop will serve as his backup while also being available to fill in at either corner outfield spot. Cecil will pitch in an intrasquad game Thursday morning on the back fields of the team's spring training complex Jenifer Langosch of MLB.com reports. Cecil was originally slated to appear in Wednesday's Grapefruit League tilt against the Marlins but he'll work in Thursday's intrasquad game instead. The veteran southpaw continues to work on both his mechanics and weight gain in anticipation of the regular season. If he irons out the issues that led to a career-worst 6.89 ERA and 1.96 WHIP in 2018 Cecil could serve as a valuable asset against left-handed hitters in the late innings for manager Mike Shildt. Bucannon signed a one-year contract $2.5 million contract with the Buccaneers on Wednesday Scott Smith of the team's official site reports. Bucannon receives $1.45 million guaranteed according to Spotrac  making it a low-risk one-year ""prove it"" type of contract for a young talent head coach Bruce Arians and defensive coordinator Todd Bowles are familiar with. The Bucs' new head man had a hand in making Bucannon a first-round pick out of Washington State in 2014 and Bowles directly oversaw the 26-year-old's transition from safety to linebacker as Arizona's defensive coordinator during Bucannon's rookie season. While Tampa has a significant need at linebacker in the wake of Kwon Alexander's departure to the 49ers via free agency Smith notably mentions that Bucannon is likely to be used ""in a variety of ways"" under Bowles including as a possible linebacker/safety hybrid on occasion. Ivory who had been the clear backup to starter LeSean McCoy entering free agency will now have competition for the No. 2 job after the Bills landed Frank Gore in free agency. When you have a 30-year-old backup to a 30-year-old starter what better way to provide depth than to bring in a 35-year-old? There's a chance Ivory could now be cut since such a move would help the Bills gain some extra cap room However the coaching staff seems to like him and the team does feature a heavy running game so the Bills could save a draft pick for something else if they're content to enter the 2019 campaign with the three elder statesmen and Marcus Murphy. Vaeao became an unrestricted free agent after the Jets did not tender him for 2019 freelance NFL writer Howard Balzer reports. Vaeao signed with the Jets prior to Week 17 after missing most of the season with the Eagles due to an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old did not play a snap in New York and played in 33 games with 27 tackles and three sacks over his three seasons in Philadelphia. Croom who had been the only remaining tight end under contract will now have competition for the starting job after the Bills landed Tyler Kroft in free agency. Kroft even though he's being handsomely compensated also doesn't have the pedigree to simply run away with the competition (he had a 42-404-7 season in 2017 surrounded by three other pro seasons with very limited production)  but this is obviously a severe hit to Croom's 2019 value. The Bills do like Croom's upside as he's still learning the position after being a wideout at Tennessee in college but at best he'll be allowed to compete for the starting job. And there's still a chance the Bills could draft a tight end early come April's draft. Burris is an unrestricted free agent after being non-tendered by the Browns freelance NFL writer Howard Balzer reports. Burris signed with the Browns in November after being let go by the Jets. The 25-year-old did not play a defensive snap over eight games between the two teams. Boddy-Calhoun is an unrestricted free agent after not being tendered by the Browns freelance NFL writer Howard Balzer reports. Boddy-Calhoun played a sizable role for the Browns in 2018 with 56 tackles (44 solo) and one forced fumble in 16 games. The 26-year-old was forced into a larger workload due to injuries but now enters 2019 as an unrestricted free agent. Randle was recalled from the G League prior to Wednesday's game against Orlando and finished with 13 points (5-7 FG 3-5 3Pt) and two rebounds over 21 minutes. It's been a hectic week for Randle to this point as he was assigned to Washington's G-League affiliate the Capital City Go Go on Tuesday before he was brought back in time for Wednesday's clash. The 26-year-old guard has found ways to make an impact in each of his team's previous two games scoring 12 and 13 points respectively. The Stanford product has seen substantial playing time off the bench when with the Wizards as he's averaging 15.1 minutes and 5.7 points through 34 matchups this year. Parker finished Wednesday's game against the Magic with 19 points (9-12 FG 1-2 3Pt 0-2 FT) nine rebounds an assist and a steal over 28 minutes. While the Wizards didn't get much production from their starting five Parker was one of three players off the bench who scored in double digits. The Duke product narrowly missed securing a double-double in a 100-90 victory at home. Parker figures to remain in a bench role moving forward despite averaging 17.4 points along with 7.0 rebounds and 2.6 assists in his previous five matchups. Bryant registered 21 points (9-12 FG 1-2 3Pt 2-2 FT) 10 rebounds an assist and two blocks over 25 minutes Wednesday against Orlando. Bryant has been held in check of late scoring just 10 points over his last two games. He managed to turn his play around Wednesday however knocking down 75.0 percent of his field goals and cleaning up on the boards. Bryant is averaging 9.8 points through seven contests in March which is just above his 9.6 ppg average on the season. Beal scored 23 points (10-22 FG 2-6 3Pt 1-2 FT) and collected six rebounds seven assists and two steals over 39 minutes Wednesday against Orlando. Beal was Washington's leading scorer in a 100-90 victory at home. He's continued to play at a high level through the first half of March and is averaging 26.5 points 8.0 rebounds 7.8 assists and 2.5 steals through seven matchups. Beal isn't showing any signs of slowing down heading into the home stretch of the regular season. Gordon finished Wednesday's game against Washington with 13 points (4-13 FG 3-6 3Pt 2-2 FT) nine rebounds four assists a block and a steal over 34 minutes. Gordon had been dealing with sore ribs leading up to Wednesday's clash although he wasn't slowed down by the issue. He's struggled from the field over his previous two matchups (9-for-30) although he's totaled 11 or more points in every game so far in March and consistently provides value for fantasy owners on the boards and as a facilitator. Gordon will take the court next against the Cavs on Thursday. Isaac accumulated 13 points (5-12 FG 3-7 3Pt) nine rebounds and two assists over 27 minutes Wednesday against the Wizards. Isaac posted his fourth straight contest of 10 or more points and he experienced success from beyond the arc. He's knocked down at least one shot from deep in each of his last four games and carries an 11.8 ppg average through six matchups in March. Jankowski has gone minus-6 with eight blocked shots and seven shots on goal in six March appearances. Notably absent is point production as the center's scoring has evaporated since the start of February. He's stuck on 25 points (10 goals 15 assists) in 67 games needing just one more to set a new career high. Jankowski emerged as a big name for shorthanded points early in the season but that was never going to be a firm foundation for him to build on long-term. Sekera has two helpers in 12 appearances this season. Sekera's second assist of the year came in Wednesday's 6-3 loss to the Devils. He's added a plus-5 rating and 14 shots on goal so far but it's a far cry from the 35 points he had in 2016-17. The 32-year-old blueliner has been slowed by injuries over the last two seasons torpedoing his fantasy value. Lucic (undisclosed) had two hits and a fight in Wednesday's 6-3 loss to the Devils. Lucic dropped the mitts with Kurtis Gabriel 3:09 into the first period to accumulate the five PIM which gives him 70 for the year. He also has 228 hits in 68 games to go with 17 points. Given the fight it's safe to say whatever injury held him out of the last two games is not going to affect his play going forward. Klefbom (undisclosed) picked up an assist in Wednesday's 6-3 loss to the Devils. Deuces were wild on his stat line in the contest with two shots two blocked shot two PIM and a minus-2 rating. The blueliner hit 20 points (five goals 15 assists) for the fourth time in five seasons. Klefbom can safely be used as normal for fantasy owners. Khaira (undisclosed) picked up a helper and dished out six hits in a 6-3 loss to the Devils on Wednesday. It's his first point in nine games a stretch interrupted by a lower-body injury. Khaira has 17 points (three goals 14 helpers) in 57 games this season as well as 117 hits. He likely won't draw much attention in the fantasy arena. Benning scored a goal and registered an assist in a 6-3 loss to the Devils on Wednesday. Benning also pumped five shots on goal blocked three shots and served up a pair of hits. The all-around strong game brings Benning to four goals and 10 assists in 58 games this season. The 24-year-old doesn't have a ton of fantasy appeal but could be a value pick in DFS while he's holding a hot stick. ¬© 2004-2019 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.
