https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/lawmakers-seek-delay-radio-spectrum-auction-next-gen-cell-service-saying-5g-plans-could,A recent view of water vapor forming a rare “bomb cyclone” over the United States captured by one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary satellites. By Paul VoosenMar. 13 2019  4:25 PM A bipartisan group of lawmakers today asked the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington D.C. to delay an auction of a wireless spectrum scheduled for tomorrow to be used for future 5G service. FCC is ignoring scientific evidence that the radio spectrum being put up on the block could interfere with crucial measurements collected by weather satellites the lawmakers say. In a letter sent to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D–TX) and Representative Frank Lucas (R–OK) the chair and ranking member respectively of the House of Representatives’s science committee say communications traffic in one segment of the spectrum that FCC is putting up for auction could compromise the satellites’ ability to track water vapor from space. Such water vapor measures are essential to predicting future rainfall tracing hurricanes and monitoring sea ice. Thanks to its intrinsic physical properties water vapor cannot be tracked at other frequencies. “Any interferences with this channel would therefore seriously impact public safety” Johnson and Lucas write. Similar concerns were raised separately in recent weeks by NASA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Defense. Johnson and Lucas voice concern “that the FCC appears to be dismissing the views and concerns of” those agencies “the National Academy of Sciences and the international community.” In late February NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who oversees NOAA asked FCC to withdraw proposed operating guidance for the spectrum because they said it would allow too much electromagnetic chatter on the radio band in question between 24.25 and 25.25 gigahertz (GHz) that might interfere with the weather data collection. (Water vapor is measured on the nearby 23.6- to 24-GHz band.) A joint NASA/NOAA study had suggested that any noise should be limited to –50 decibel watts (dBW); the Europeans for example recently defined their noise threshold at –56 dBW. The FCC auction however would allow –20 dBW of noise a significantly higher level especially given its measure on a logarithmic scale. On 8 March however Pai rejected NASA and NOAA’s request and stated his intent to proceed with the auction. The Department of State which served as an arbiter between the agencies previously sided with FCC in the fight. Whether Congress’s late engagement in the dispute will change FCC’s calculations remains to be seen. doi:10.1126/science.aax3274 Paul Voosen is a staff writer who covers Earth and planetary science.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/scienceinsider,By Paul VoosenMar. 13 2019 A recent view of water vapor forming a rare “bomb cyclone” over the United States captured by one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary satellites. A bipartisan group of lawmakers today asked the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington D.C. to delay an auction of a wireless spectrum scheduled for tomorrow to be used for future 5G service. FCC is ignoring scientific evidence that the radio spectrum being put up on the block could interfere with crucial measurements collected by weather satellites the lawmakers say. In a letter sent to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D–TX) and Representative Frank Lucas (R–OK) the chair and ranking member respectively of the House of Representatives’s science committee say communications traffic in one segment of the spectrum that FCC is putting up for auction could compromise the satellites’ ability to track water vapor from space. Such water vapor measures are essential to predicting future rainfall tracing hurricanes and monitoring sea ice. Thanks to its intrinsic physical properties water vapor cannot be tracked at other frequencies. “Any interferences with this channel would therefore seriously impact public safety” Johnson and Lucas write.

A prominent group of 18 scientists and bioethicists from seven countries has called for a global “moratorium” on introducing heritable changes into human sperm eggs or embryos—germline editing—to make genetically altered children. The group which published a commentary in Nature today hopes to influence a long-standing debate that dramatically intensified after China’s He Jiankui announced in November 2018 that he used the genome editor CRISPR to try to alter the genes of babies to be resistant to the AIDS virus. Their call which is endorsed in the same issue of Nature by Francis Collins director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health is a departure from statements issued by two global summits on genome editing in 2015 and 2018 a 2017 report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) and a 2018 report from the United Kingdom’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics. None has banned human germline editing and most have stressed that it holds promise to help correct some heritable diseases. All have warned against using germline editing for cognitive or physical “enhancement” of people. Scientists including Nobel laureate David Baltimore of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena remain opposed to a moratorium. Even in the wake of the He incident Baltimore who helped organize the summits denounced such a ban as “draconian” and “antithetical to the goals of science.” Any nation that wants to greenlight a human germline edit by its scientists the 18 authors declare should have to give public notice engage in an international and transparent assessment of whether the intervention is justified and make sure the work has broad support in their own nation. “Nations might well choose different paths but they would agree to proceed openly and with due respect to the opinions of humankind on an issue that will ultimately affect the entire species” they write. They strongly encourage that nonscientific perspectives including those of people with disabilities and religious groups be included in the discussion. And they stress that they are not calling for a moratorium on genome editing of somatic cells which would not affect future generations. By Katie LanginMar. 13 2019 The job market for U.S. science and engineering Ph.D.s is about to pass a long-anticipated milestone. For decades educational institutions have been the largest employer of Ph.D.s. In 1997 for instance they eclipsed private sector employment by 11 percentage points according to the U.S. National Science Foundation’s (NSF’s) biennial Survey of Doctorate Recipients. But the academic job market has not kept pace with the supply of graduates and the equivalent data for 2017—released last month—reveals a very different picture: For the first time private sector employment (42%) is now nearly on par with educational institutions (43%). The trend is particularly striking in the life and health sciences the fields that award the most Ph.D.s. In 2017 only 23% of these Ph.D.s held a tenured or tenure track position in academia—a drop of 10 percentage points since 1997. Only math and the computer sciences have seen a larger drop from 49% to 33%. Those 20-year shifts outpace changes in psychology and the social sciences (35% to 30%) engineering (23% to 16%) and the physical and earth sciences (22% to 19%). The numbers understate the impact on today’s academic job seekers says Paula Stephan a labor economist at Georgia State University in Atlanta who studies the scientific workforce. That’s because NSF’s data include all U.S.-trained Ph.D.s under 76 years of age who are employed full time in the United States. Newer cohorts are less likely to secure the tenure track position that many covet Stephan says. “We’re in a system where … lots of really smart people are going to get faculty jobs and lots of really smart people aren’t” adds Gary McDowell executive director of Future of Research a nonprofit organization in San Francisco California that advocates on behalf of early-career researchers. By Kai KupferschmidtMar. 12 2019 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited an Ebola treatment center in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 9 March. In a speech last week Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recalled the posters about smallpox that he saw as a child in his hometown Asmara in what is now Eritrea. “I remember hearing about an organization called the World Health Organization [WHO] that was ridding the world of this terrifying disease one vaccination at a time” he said. Much has changed since then. Smallpox was vanquished; Tedros who’s Ethiopian is the first African head of WHO; and in a series of reforms laid out in the same speech he is trying to restore the storied organization to health. The changes aim to bring more talent to WHO and improve coordination between its headquarters in Geneva Switzerland and six regional offices. But some observers say Tedros’s agenda doesn’t address long-standing problems including a chronic shortage of money little power over how to spend it and the regional offices’ prickly independence. “The main problems of WHO are unsolved by this reform” says Lawrence Gostin director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. Founded in 1948 as a United Nations agency to promote public health WHO is partly financed by 194 member states but most of its $4 billion annual budget comes from donors many of whom earmark their contributions for specific projects. Tedros became director-general in 2017 succeeding Margaret Chan who was heavily criticized for her handling of the West African Ebola epidemic. In last week’s speech Tedros recalled the lofty new goals WHO set last year: ensuring that by 2023 1 billion more people benefit from universal health coverage 1 billion people are better protected from health emergencies and 1 billion people enjoy better health. To achieve them Tedros said will require “changing the DNA of the organization.” By Jocelyn KaiserMar. 12 2019 Ned Sharpless Norman Sharpless director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda Maryland will become acting administrator of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Silver Spring Maryland after current FDA chief Scott Gottlieb steps down in early April. The announcement came this morning from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing. “Dr. Sharpless’ deep scientific background and expertise will make him a strong leader for FDA” Azar said in a statement. “There will be no let-up in the agency’s focus from ongoing efforts on drug approvals and combating the opioid crisis to modernizing food safety and addressing the rapid rise in youth use of e-cigarettes.” Gottlieb's resignation to spend more time with his young family in Connecticut rattled markets and FDA watchers when it was announced last week. That uncertainty is at least temporarily eased by the acting appointment of Sharpless a physician-scientist and former director of the University of North Carolina’s cancer center in Chapel Hill who has drawn praise as NCI director since October 2017. By Meredith WadmanMar. 11 2019 Students sat in on 27 February at the office of Vanderbilt University Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos in Nashville in support of #MeToo advocate BethAnn McLaughlin. A faculty grievance committee last month upheld a decision to deny tenure to BethAnn McLaughlin a neuroscientist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville who has become a prominent spokesperson for the #MeToo movement in science. “We do not find any justification to overturn the recommendation … to deny tenure” the five-member ad hoc Grievance Committee composed of professors from diverse disciplines at the university and its graduate schools wrote in a report obtained by ScienceInsider. The committee’s word in the 12 February report is not final. The university’s chancellor Nicholas Zeppos can overturn its decision if he justifies his move in writing to the executive committee of the university’s Board of Trust. By Jon CohenMar. 11 2019 Community health workers with the Population Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy to Reduce HIV Transmission study did door-to-door HIV testing of 1 million people annually for 3 years. SEATTLE WASHINGTON—The recipe for ending HIV epidemics seems straightforward. Introduce widespread testing. Immediately put those who test positive on antiretroviral (ARV) drugs which suppress the virus to undetectable levels so those people won’t infect others. The number of new infections will drop and the epidemic will peter out. But massive costly studies done in the past few years have failed to show this strategy can reliably curb the spread of the virus to the frustration of researchers. The latest and largest ever study presented here last week at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections did show a modest benefit. But confusingly there was almost no decline in infections in the study group where it was most expected. Ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be harder than anticipated it seems. “ARVs on their own are not the magic bullet” says Collins Iwuji an epidemiologist at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom who helped run one of the earlier studies a South African treatment as prevention (TasP) trial. By Linda NordlingMar. 11 2019 Muntaser Ibrahim A leading Sudanese geneticist has been imprisoned for speaking out against the country’s repressive regime. Muntaser Ibrahim who heads the University of Khartoum’s Institute of Endemic Diseases was arrested on 21 February in Khartoum and has been detained ever since. His friends and family do not know his location. They say Ibrahim suffers from a heart condition that requires specialist care. Ibrahim’s colleagues and students issued a statement calling for his release on Friday. “It is deplorable that a scholar such as Professor Ibrahim remains in prison rather than classroom and research centres” the text reads. Ibrahim took part in peaceful antiregime protests in recent months according to the statement; he was arrested twice in early January but released shortly after both times. The third and final arrest came as Ibrahim planned to deliver suggestions for national reform drawn up by him and other University of Khartoum lecturers to Sudan’s president Omar Al-Bashir. “Professor Ibrahim and his colleagues genuinely believed that their initiative could provide a satisfactory way out of the crisis but the dictatorial authority saw otherwise hence his repeated incarceration” reads the statement which is unsigned. By Science News StaffMar. 11 2019 President Donald Trump For the third year in a row President Donald Trump’s administration has unveiled a budget request to Congress that calls for deep spending cuts at many federal science agencies including a 13% cut for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and a 12% cut for the National Science Foundation (NSF) while providing hefty increases for the military. But the $4.7 trillion request for the 2020 fiscal year that begins 1 October released today is already drawing bipartisan pushback from lawmakers in Congress and—as with past Trump administration requests—many of the cuts are unlikely to be enacted into law. The president’s science adviser Kelvin Droegemeier calls the request “an important down payment on America’s future.” A statement from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) which he leads says the president’s budget “promotes responsible spending [by] prioritizing high-impact programs that have been shown to be effective.” By Jocelyn KaiserMar. 8 2019 A headline-grabbing study out this week is adding to concerns about gender bias in science: Women received about $40000 less than men in their first funding award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or just $127000 per year. But surprisingly women’s median award size was larger than men’s for NIH’s standard independent research grant. A close look at the data which cover more than 200 different kinds of grants awarded by NIH suggests the story is more nuanced than the overall numbers indicate. Researchers at Northwestern University in Evanston Illinois examined 53903 grants from 2006 to 2017 that went to first-time principal investigators (PIs). Men and women didn’t differ significantly in some research metrics such as the number of publications. Yet the median size of a grant for male PIs was $165721 whereas for women it was just $126615 or 24% smaller the authors reported on 5 March in JAMA. The results were even more striking for some types of institutions: At Big Ten public universities for example grants to men were more than twice as large as those to women ($148076 versus $66365). That difference has profound implications for a woman’s scientific career the study’s authors say. “This shows women are disadvantaged from the very first NIH grant they submit relative to their male counterparts. This represents an early stumbling block” that means women have less money for equipment and hiring graduate students corresponding author Teresa Woodruff wrote in a press release. NIH too “is aware and concerned about differences in funding patterns between women and men in science” the Bethesda Maryland–based agency wrote in a statement.

https://www.sciencemag.org/author/paul-voosen,Paul began in journalism as an intern at the Atlantic Monthly in its final Boston days followed by several years at an alumni magazine and then the Prague Post the Czech expat newspaper where he visited Europe's last uranium mine and the radon spas of Jachymov. He returned to science coverage full-time after attending the MA in science journalism at Columbia University. Over the past decade as an enterprise reporter at Greenwire and then the Chronicle of Higher Education Paul has covered nearly every scientific discipline with the geosciences a constant from series on clouds and carbon capture to a profile of the psychologist who exposed the roots of climate polarization. At Science he'll hone his coverage on Earth and beyond and most importantly on what gets left out when the final study appears—the researchers and messy realities behind scientific work. He's a graduate of Boston College where he dabbled in physics computer science and English. In 2013 Paul received the Perlman news award from the American Geophysical Union and in 2015 he was named an emerging writer at the Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference. Paul Voosen is a staff writer who covers Earth and planetary science.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/waterfall-chasing-scientists-uncover-rare-self-forming-cascades,By Alex FoxMar. 13 2019  2:00 PM Most waterfalls tell a clear story about their origins: Yosemite Falls in California cascades over a sheer granite cliff the remains of ice age glaciers that once carved out the valley’s steep walls. Others are the result of major earthquakes or sudden changes in rock type. But some like the Seven Teacups in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains (above) have no obvious external cause. Now scientists have a new potential explanation for these mysterious waterfalls. What makes the Seven Teacups so inscrutable is the unbroken granite slope they’re etched into. There’s no sudden cliff to suggest that past earthquakes or retreating glaciers created the falls and the composition of the granite is roughly the same throughout meaning a change from harder to softer rock wasn’t responsible for the falls’ creation. To test whether such a waterfall could form without external causes researchers built a 7.3-meter artificial river or flume with a 20% downhill slope. For 20 minutes at a time researchers sent a steady flow of gravel-laden water along a flat riverbed made of soft foam. Then the team used a laser scanner to measure any changes in the surface of the foam riverbed. Over the course of 11 trials the gravel and water wore away tiny undulations in the foam. Two of those depressions got deeper and deeper until they became miniature selfmade waterfalls the researchers report today in Nature. Feedback from the water the gravel and the erosion of the artificial riverbed interacted to make the cascades suggesting the same mechanism could be responsible for waterfalls like the Seven Teacups. To determine how widespread this phenomenon is the researchers say they’ll need to chase more waterfalls—and develop some way to identify these selfmade cascades. The findings could clarify the origins of such waterfalls on Earth and even Mars where astronomers have spotted dried-up riverbeds—and what may be the remains of martian waterfalls. If waterfalls can arise without external causes scientists will need to be cautious in using them to reverse engineer the Red Planet’s history. doi:10.1126/science.aax3119 Vol 363 Issue 6431 Table of Contents © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/rain-melting-greenland-s-ice-even-winter-raising-fears-about-sea-level-rise,Study co-author Marco Tedesco of Columbia University studies a rushing meltwater stream within Greenland’s Russell Glacier in July 2018. By Alex FoxMar. 7 2019  9:00 AM Rising global temperatures are making Greenland feel a bit more like the United Kingdom—and that’s bad news for the ice sheet that covers the massive arctic island. Rain is becoming more frequent melting ice and setting the stage for far more melt in the future according to a new study. Even more disturbing researchers say is that raindrops are pockmarking areas of the ice sheet even in the dead of winter and that as the climate warms those areas will expand. “This is what climate change looks like it’s the ‘Atlantification’ of the Arctic” says climate scientist Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen who was not involved in the study. “This paper identifies a really important mechanism and we need to figure out how it plays into our predictions of sea level rise.” Each year the hot knife of climate change excises 270 billion tons of ice from Greenland’s more than 1.7-million-square-kilometer ice sheet. Between 1992 and 2011 all that lost ice raised global sea level roughly 7.5 millimeters. Roughly half of the ice loss in that period occurred at the ice sheet’s edge in the form of icebergs cleaving from glaciers and thundering into the sea. But in recent years satellite monitoring has revealed that 70% of Greenland’s contributions to sea level rise has come from meltwater not ice. Since melting on the surface of the ice sheet came to dominate in 2011 Greenland’s annual contribution to global sea level rise has doubled. Warming has driven this acceleration and over the past 30 years or so average air temperatures at the ice sheet warmed by as much as 1.8°C in summer and up to 3°C in winter. To better understand the causes of this accelerating melt climate scientists used more than 30 years of satellite data to pinpoint “melt events” when the amount of liquid water on the ice sheet suddenly increased. To detect these events the satellites exploited liquid water’s unique ability to absorb and emit microwave radiation from the sun. Water emits 100 times more microwave radiation than snow allowing the satellites to detect even slight increases. By combining the satellite data with local weather readings the team could determine whether rain or other factors instigated melt events. The researchers identified 313 melt events caused by rain from 1979 to 2012. Over the study period the melt caused by rainy weather doubled during summer and tripled during winter the team reports today in The Cryosphere. The weather patterns sending this moisture to Greenland are not new says lead author Marilena Oltmanns of Germany’s GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. But because the background temperature is higher more of this moisture is falling as rain rather than snow. The impacts of this rain on the ice sheet extend beyond the moment drops are falling says study co-author Marco Tedesco of Columbia University. Rain in Greenland is typically delivered by warm moisture-laden winds from the south. These clouds linger trapping the warm air they rode in on like a blanket driving increased melting for days after the rain subsides. The wintertime rain could have even more lasting consequences. Rain-induced melt in winter may quickly refreeze but the rained-on snow forms a crusty layer that absorbs more sunlight than fresh powder. After decades of increasingly frequent winter rain the snowpack contains so many of these layers that they accelerate melting when exposed to the sun in the summer Tedesco says. The surface melting caused by rain could even be accelerating the flow of glaciers increasing the quantity of ice they deliver into the sea Oltmanns says. If further work shows meltwater seeping beneath the glaciers does speed their march to the sea it could lead to even more ice loss than the rain itself she says. Greenland holds enough ice to deliver 7 meters of sea level rise—enough to submerge much of lower Manhattan in New York City—but predicting how fast that rise occurs requires work like this detailed the mechanisms behind the melt. “These systems have the potential to cause big changes” Oltmanns says. “How little we understand about them is frightening.” doi:10.1126/science.aax2520 By Paul VoosenMar. 13 2019 By Jon CohenMar. 13 2019 By Katie LanginMar. 13 2019 By Kai KupferschmidtMar. 12 2019 By Jocelyn KaiserMar. 12 2019 More ScienceInsider Mar. 6 2019 Mar. 1 2019 Feb. 26 2019 Feb. 25 2019 Feb. 11 2019 More Sifter Vol 363 Issue 6431 Table of Contents © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/these-falling-drops-don-t-splash-they-spin,By Lakshmi SupriyaMar. 5 2019  11:00 AM Falling drops usually make a splash but these drops do the twist. Researchers have created surfaces that can make droplets spin and whirl at more than 7300 revolutions per minute when they rebound. To make the water droplets spin researchers first had to make sure they didn’t wet the surface they fell on—otherwise they’d just splash. The researchers did this by coating alumina plates with a fluorinated nonstick coating similar to those found in nonstick cooking pans. Next they masked some regions of the surface and shone ultraviolet (UV) light on the entire plate. The regions exposed to the UV became highly “wettable” meaning water touching those regions spread out immediately rather than bouncing back up. The team created several designs of the wettable regions including one with spiral arms radiating out from a center much like a pinwheel. As the droplet bounds up from the patterned surface the portions encountering the wettable spirals stick to the surface whereas the parts of the droplet in contact with the water-repelling surface rebound immediately. This creates a set of unbalanced forces pulling on the droplet more in some parts than in others twisting it the team reports today in Nature Communications. Depending on the design of the wettable and nonwettable regions not only can drops be made to rotate but can also roll deflect or show a combination of different motions making droplets dance to the tune of the surface patterns. Controlling how liquid drops bounce off a surface may be useful in many areas such self-cleaning surfaces deicing applications or for mixing different materials. doi:10.1126/science.aax2330 Vol 363 Issue 6431 Table of Contents © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/ancient-slaughter-140-children-marks-largest-child-sacrifice-americas,By Lizzie WadeMar. 6 2019  5:00 PM Around 1450 C.E. on the northern coast of Peru more than 140 children and 200 young llamas were marched to their deaths. It’s one of the largest known sacrifices of children in history the Los Angeles Times reports. The site called Huanchaquito-Las Llamas was part of the Chimú Empire and the chemical isotopes preserved in the children’s bones suggest they came from all over Chimú territory National Geographic adds. Normally the region is very dry and the Chimú relied on complex irrigation systems to grow enough food. But the sacrificed children boys and girls ranging from 6 to 14 years old were buried in a thick layer of mud suggesting that at the time they were killed an El Niño event was causing heavy rains and catastrophic floods. The sacrifice might have been performed in an attempt to stop the rain. Vol 363 Issue 6431 Table of Contents © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science. All rights Reserved.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/one-oldest-tattooing-needles-north-america,By Alex FoxMar. 1 2019  10:45 AM Digging through material collected in Utah more than 40 years ago an archaeologist discovered the oldest tattooing tool ever found in western North America National Geographic reports. The artifact is about the size of a pen and its points are formed by a pair of cactus spines—tips stained black by ink some 2000 years old researchers report in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports. Originally collected within Bears Ears National Monument the tattooing needle is 1000 years older than the runner-up. The artifact went unstudied for decades inside a bag filled with bones hair and corn cobs stored at Washington State University in Pullman where it was finally recognized for what it was. The needle helps researchers understand the history of tattooing and its connection to ancient Native American cultures.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/dead-whale-makes-ocean-s-abyss-come-alive,By Alex FoxFeb. 26 2019  12:55 PM In 2011 a 20-meter-long fin whale washed up on a beach near San Diego California. Shortly thereafter scientists got permission to drag its 23-ton body 20 kilometers out to sea where they strapped it to 7 tons of scrap metal and sank it roughly 1 kilometer down to the bottom of the ocean The New Yorker reports. This whale killed by a ship presented a rare opportunity for deep-sea biologists to study the procession of creatures drawn to consume the corpse. Five missions visited the whale nicknamed Rosebud over the years as its profusion of white blubber and purple muscle gave way to an austere skeleton. How long it takes for the scavengers of the deep to consume a whale varies by location but researchers estimate it could take half a century or more for Rosebud to disappear.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/physics-why-packing-tape-such-pain-use,By Alex FoxFeb. 25 2019  3:25 PM Packing tape hardly glides off the spool—it hiccups and jerks only to release a prodigious ribbon that needs to be cut down to size. Now researchers have used slow-motion microscopic video to explain the physics underlying this sticky mystery Physics Today reports. The videos showed that the longer the tape got stuck the more tape it unspooled when it slipped the team reported earlier this month in Physical Review Letters. Researchers used those observations to create a mathematical model that fits their measurements of the tape’s sticks and slips. The model also predicts that the tape peels up from what it’s stuck to from side to side like a wave and not as a uniform front. Future research will seek to explain why at the microscale the tape seems to peel sideways. Vol 363 Issue 6431 Table of Contents © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/scientists-bust-beer-wine-folk-wisdom,By Alex FoxFeb. 11 2019  3:05 PM Despite the old saying drinking beer before wine offers no hangover relief The Guardian reports. To find out whether this bit of British folk wisdom offered any protection from the aftermath of a night of drinking researchers got 90 volunteers equally drunk—one group switched from beer to wine a second group went from wine to beer and a third group stuck with either just beer or just wine. After the volunteers drank their way to a blood alcohol content of 0.11% they each scored the severity of the resulting hangover the next day. The researchers repeated the experiment twice moving the volunteers into different groups. No matter what group they were in they fared just as badly the next day the researchers report this month in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. So for those looking to avoid a hangover it appears the only magic bullet is drinking less in the first place.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/lawmakers-seek-delay-radio-spectrum-auction-next-gen-cell-service-saying-5g-plans-could,A recent view of water vapor forming a rare â€œbomb cycloneâ€ over the United States captured by one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s geostationary satellites. By Paul VoosenMar. 13 2019  4:25 PM A bipartisan group of lawmakers today asked the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington D.C. to delay an auction of a wireless spectrum scheduled for tomorrow to be used for future 5G service. FCC is ignoring scientific evidence that the radio spectrum being put up on the block could interfere with crucial measurements collected by weather satellites the lawmakers say. In a letter sent to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (Dâ€“TX) and Representative Frank Lucas (Râ€“OK) the chair and ranking member respectively of the House of Representativesâ€™s science committee say communications traffic in one segment of the spectrum that FCC is putting up for auction could compromise the satellitesâ€™ ability to track water vapor from space. Such water vapor measures are essential to predicting future rainfall tracing hurricanes and monitoring sea ice. Thanks to its intrinsic physical properties water vapor cannot be tracked at other frequencies. â€œAny interferences with this channel would therefore seriously impact public safetyâ€ Johnson and Lucas write. Similar concerns were raised separately in recent weeks by NASA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Defense. Johnson and Lucas voice concern â€œthat the FCC appears to be dismissing the views and concerns ofâ€ those agencies â€œthe National Academy of Sciences and the international community.â€ In late February NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who oversees NOAA asked FCC to withdraw proposed operating guidance for the spectrum because they said it would allow too much electromagnetic chatter on the radio band in question between 24.25 and 25.25 gigahertz (GHz) that might interfere with the weather data collection. (Water vapor is measured on the nearby 23.6- to 24-GHz band.) A joint NASA/NOAA study had suggested that any noise should be limited to â€“50 decibel watts (dBW); the Europeans for example recently defined their noise threshold at â€“56 dBW. The FCC auction however would allow â€“20 dBW of noise a significantly higher level especially given its measure on a logarithmic scale. On 8 March however Pai rejected NASA and NOAAâ€™s request and stated his intent to proceed with the auction. The Department of State which served as an arbiter between the agencies previously sided with FCC in the fight. Whether Congressâ€™s late engagement in the dispute will change FCCâ€™s calculations remains to be seen. doi:10.1126/science.aax3274 Paul Voosen is a staff writer who covers Earth and planetary science.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/scienceinsider,By Paul VoosenMar. 13 2019 A recent view of water vapor forming a rare â€œbomb cycloneâ€ over the United States captured by one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s geostationary satellites. A bipartisan group of lawmakers today asked the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington D.C. to delay an auction of a wireless spectrum scheduled for tomorrow to be used for future 5G service. FCC is ignoring scientific evidence that the radio spectrum being put up on the block could interfere with crucial measurements collected by weather satellites the lawmakers say. In a letter sent to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (Dâ€“TX) and Representative Frank Lucas (Râ€“OK) the chair and ranking member respectively of the House of Representativesâ€™s science committee say communications traffic in one segment of the spectrum that FCC is putting up for auction could compromise the satellitesâ€™ ability to track water vapor from space. Such water vapor measures are essential to predicting future rainfall tracing hurricanes and monitoring sea ice. Thanks to its intrinsic physical properties water vapor cannot be tracked at other frequencies. â€œAny interferences with this channel would therefore seriously impact public safetyâ€ Johnson and Lucas write. By Jon CohenMar. 13 2019 Conducting research that alters human embryos with the genome editor CRISPR (shown here) would not be banned if a proposed moratorium goes in place but implanting altered human embryos would. A prominent group of 18 scientists and bioethicists from seven countries has called for a global â€œmoratoriumâ€ on introducing heritable changes into human sperm eggs or embryosâ€”germline editingâ€”to make genetically altered children. The group which published a commentary in Nature today hopes to influence a long-standing debate that dramatically intensified after Chinaâ€™s He Jiankui announced in November 2018 that he used the genome editor CRISPR to try to alter the genes of babies to be resistant to the AIDS virus. Their call which is endorsed in the same issue of Nature by Francis Collins director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health is a departure from statements issued by two global summits on genome editing in 2015 and 2018 a 2017 report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) and a 2018 report from the United Kingdomâ€™s Nuffield Council on Bioethics. None has banned human germline editing and most have stressed that it holds promise to help correct some heritable diseases. All have warned against using germline editing for cognitive or physical â€œenhancementâ€ of people. Scientists including Nobel laureate David Baltimore of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena remain opposed to a moratorium. Even in the wake of the He incident Baltimore who helped organize the summits denounced such a ban as â€œdraconianâ€ and â€œantithetical to the goals of science.â€ Any nation that wants to greenlight a human germline edit by its scientists the 18 authors declare should have to give public notice engage in an international and transparent assessment of whether the intervention is justified and make sure the work has broad support in their own nation. â€œNations might well choose different paths but they would agree to proceed openly and with due respect to the opinions of humankind on an issue that will ultimately affect the entire speciesâ€ they write. They strongly encourage that nonscientific perspectives including those of people with disabilities and religious groups be included in the discussion. And they stress that they are not calling for a moratorium on genome editing of somatic cells which would not affect future generations. By Katie LanginMar. 13 2019 The job market for U.S. science and engineering Ph.D.s is about to pass a long-anticipated milestone. For decades educational institutions have been the largest employer of Ph.D.s. In 1997 for instance they eclipsed private sector employment by 11 percentage points according to the U.S. National Science Foundationâ€™s (NSFâ€™s) biennial Survey of Doctorate Recipients. But the academic job market has not kept pace with the supply of graduates and the equivalent data for 2017â€”released last monthâ€”reveals a very different picture: For the first time private sector employment (42%) is now nearly on par with educational institutions (43%). The trend is particularly striking in the life and health sciences the fields that award the most Ph.D.s. In 2017 only 23% of these Ph.D.s held a tenured or tenure track position in academiaâ€”a drop of 10 percentage points since 1997. Only math and the computer sciences have seen a larger drop from 49% to 33%. Those 20-year shifts outpace changes in psychology and the social sciences (35% to 30%) engineering (23% to 16%) and the physical and earth sciences (22% to 19%). The numbers understate the impact on todayâ€™s academic job seekers says Paula Stephan a labor economist at Georgia State University in Atlanta who studies the scientific workforce. Thatâ€™s because NSFâ€™s data include all U.S.-trained Ph.D.s under 76 years of age who are employed full time in the United States. Newer cohorts are less likely to secure the tenure track position that many covet Stephan says. â€œWeâ€™re in a system where â€¦ lots of really smart people are going to get faculty jobs and lots of really smart people arenâ€™tâ€ adds Gary McDowell executive director of Future of Research a nonprofit organization in San Francisco California that advocates on behalf of early-career researchers. By Kai KupferschmidtMar. 12 2019 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited an Ebola treatment center in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 9 March. In a speech last week Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recalled the posters about smallpox that he saw as a child in his hometown Asmara in what is now Eritrea. â€œI remember hearing about an organization called the World Health Organization [WHO] that was ridding the world of this terrifying disease one vaccination at a timeâ€ he said. Much has changed since then. Smallpox was vanquished; Tedros whoâ€™s Ethiopian is the first African head of WHO; and in a series of reforms laid out in the same speech he is trying to restore the storied organization to health. The changes aim to bring more talent to WHO and improve coordination between its headquarters in Geneva Switzerland and six regional offices. But some observers say Tedrosâ€™s agenda doesnâ€™t address long-standing problems including a chronic shortage of money little power over how to spend it and the regional officesâ€™ prickly independence. â€œThe main problems of WHO are unsolved by this reformâ€ says Lawrence Gostin director of the Oâ€™Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. Founded in 1948 as a United Nations agency to promote public health WHO is partly financed by 194 member states but most of its $4 billion annual budget comes from donors many of whom earmark their contributions for specific projects. Tedros became director-general in 2017 succeeding Margaret Chan who was heavily criticized for her handling of the West African Ebola epidemic. In last weekâ€™s speech Tedros recalled the lofty new goals WHO set last year: ensuring that by 2023 1 billion more people benefit from universal health coverage 1 billion people are better protected from health emergencies and 1 billion people enjoy better health. To achieve them Tedros said will require â€œchanging the DNA of the organization.â€ By Jocelyn KaiserMar. 12 2019 Ned Sharpless Norman Sharpless director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda Maryland will become acting administrator of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Silver Spring Maryland after current FDA chief Scott Gottlieb steps down in early April. The announcement came this morning from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing. â€œDr. Sharplessâ€™ deep scientific background and expertise will make him a strong leader for FDAâ€ Azar said in a statement. â€œThere will be no let-up in the agencyâ€™s focus from ongoing efforts on drug approvals and combating the opioid crisis to modernizing food safety and addressing the rapid rise in youth use of e-cigarettes.â€ Gottlieb's resignation to spend more time with his young family in Connecticut rattled markets and FDA watchers when it was announced last week. That uncertainty is at least temporarily eased by the acting appointment of Sharpless a physician-scientist and former director of the University of North Carolinaâ€™s cancer center in Chapel Hill who has drawn praise as NCI director since October 2017. By Meredith WadmanMar. 11 2019 Students sat in on 27 February at the office of Vanderbilt University Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos in Nashville in support of #MeToo advocate BethAnn McLaughlin. A faculty grievance committee last month upheld a decision to deny tenure to BethAnn McLaughlin a neuroscientist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville who has become a prominent spokesperson for the #MeToo movement in science. â€œWe do not find any justification to overturn the recommendation â€¦ to deny tenureâ€ the five-member ad hoc Grievance Committee composed of professors from diverse disciplines at the university and its graduate schools wrote in a report obtained by ScienceInsider. The committeeâ€™s word in the 12 February report is not final. The universityâ€™s chancellor Nicholas Zeppos can overturn its decision if he justifies his move in writing to the executive committee of the universityâ€™s Board of Trust. By Jon CohenMar. 11 2019 Community health workers with the Population Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy to Reduce HIV Transmission study did door-to-door HIV testing of 1 million people annually for 3 years. SEATTLE WASHINGTONâ€”The recipe for ending HIV epidemics seems straightforward. Introduce widespread testing. Immediately put those who test positive on antiretroviral (ARV) drugs which suppress the virus to undetectable levels so those people wonâ€™t infect others. The number of new infections will drop and the epidemic will peter out. But massive costly studies done in the past few years have failed to show this strategy can reliably curb the spread of the virus to the frustration of researchers. The latest and largest ever study presented here last week at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections did show a modest benefit. But confusingly there was almost no decline in infections in the study group where it was most expected. Ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic may be harder than anticipated it seems. â€œARVs on their own are not the magic bulletâ€ says Collins Iwuji an epidemiologist at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom who helped run one of the earlier studies a South African treatment as prevention (TasP) trial. By Linda NordlingMar. 11 2019 Muntaser Ibrahim A leading Sudanese geneticist has been imprisoned for speaking out against the countryâ€™s repressive regime. Muntaser Ibrahim who heads the University of Khartoumâ€™s Institute of Endemic Diseases was arrested on 21 February in Khartoum and has been detained ever since. His friends and family do not know his location. They say Ibrahim suffers from a heart condition that requires specialist care. Ibrahimâ€™s colleagues and students issued a statement calling for his release on Friday. â€œIt is deplorable that a scholar such as Professor Ibrahim remains in prison rather than classroom and research centresâ€ the text reads. Ibrahim took part in peaceful antiregime protests in recent months according to the statement; he was arrested twice in early January but released shortly after both times. The third and final arrest came as Ibrahim planned to deliver suggestions for national reform drawn up by him and other University of Khartoum lecturers to Sudanâ€™s president Omar Al-Bashir. â€œProfessor Ibrahim and his colleagues genuinely believed that their initiative could provide a satisfactory way out of the crisis but the dictatorial authority saw otherwise hence his repeated incarcerationâ€ reads the statement which is unsigned. By Science News StaffMar. 11 2019 President Donald Trump For the third year in a row President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration has unveiled a budget request to Congress that calls for deep spending cuts at many federal science agencies including a 13% cut for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and a 12% cut for the National Science Foundation (NSF) while providing hefty increases for the military. But the $4.7 trillion request for the 2020 fiscal year that begins 1 October released today is already drawing bipartisan pushback from lawmakers in Congress andâ€”as with past Trump administration requestsâ€”many of the cuts are unlikely to be enacted into law. The presidentâ€™s science adviser Kelvin Droegemeier calls the request â€œan important down payment on Americaâ€™s future.â€ A statement from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) which he leads says the presidentâ€™s budget â€œpromotes responsible spending [by] prioritizing high-impact programs that have been shown to be effective.â€ By Jocelyn KaiserMar. 8 2019 A headline-grabbing study out this week is adding to concerns about gender bias in science: Women received about $40000 less than men in their first funding award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or just $127000 per year. But surprisingly womenâ€™s median award size was larger than menâ€™s for NIHâ€™s standard independent research grant. A close look at the data which cover more than 200 different kinds of grants awarded by NIH suggests the story is more nuanced than the overall numbers indicate. Researchers at Northwestern University in Evanston Illinois examined 53903 grants from 2006 to 2017 that went to first-time principal investigators (PIs). Men and women didnâ€™t differ significantly in some research metrics such as the number of publications. Yet the median size of a grant for male PIs was $165721 whereas for women it was just $126615 or 24% smaller the authors reported on 5 March in JAMA. The results were even more striking for some types of institutions: At Big Ten public universities for example grants to men were more than twice as large as those to women ($148076 versus $66365). That difference has profound implications for a womanâ€™s scientific career the studyâ€™s authors say. â€œThis shows women are disadvantaged from the very first NIH grant they submit relative to their male counterparts. This represents an early stumbling blockâ€ that means women have less money for equipment and hiring graduate students corresponding author Teresa Woodruff wrote in a press release. NIH too â€œis aware and concerned about differences in funding patterns between women and men in scienceâ€ the Bethesda Marylandâ€“based agency wrote in a statement.
