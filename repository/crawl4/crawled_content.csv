https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dominion_Special_Forces,- Faction description(src) The Dominion Special Forces are a unit/branch of the armed forces of the Terran Dominion. They are outfitted with some of the best technology in the Dominion and make use of some of the greatest soldiers and hardware. The Special Forces are are brought in to make the best of bad situations. Their high-tech buildings have been engineered for stealth durability and performance under the most extreme conditions. (src) A Dominion Special Forces marine The Dominion Special Forces are an elite branch of the Terran Dominion devoted to covert ops missions and specialist assignments. The Dominion Special Forces often must go into situations where they are outnumbered and thus have to make use of some of the best technology the Dominion has to offer. Emperor Valerian Mengsk himself oversaw vast research grants and reforms to their organization. A Dominion Special Forces banshee The Dominion Special Forces have access to some exclusive vehicles including the Moirai-class battlecruiser. Other vehicles such as their cyclones and hellions are modified to suit specific environments and missions. The Dominion Special Forces also makes use of the latest in neosteel advancements allowing for more flexible version of transforming units such as thors and liberators. Their ravens are the pride of their force and supposedly can hear a Kel-Morian miner whispering two kilometers underground. While one's service in the Special Forces may not always last long many marines agree there's never a dull moment on the job. Dominion Special Forces structures The Dominion Special Forces utilize a number of advanced structures as well including powerful missile turrets improved engineering bays with advanced AI improved reactors and tech labs and advanced production structures. Powerful fusion cores four times as powerful as the standard model are utilized to field their battlecruisers. The advanced sensor towers they utilize once picked up a large moth which led to the destruction of a Mar Sara trading post and the scaling back of the sensitivity of their towers. The Dominion Special Forces once had a covert operation result in considerable losses resulting in the force using a greater number of medivac dropships. After the End War the special forces took part in the recovery of xel'naga construct remnants leading to advancements in neosteel design. They were also able to pilfer protoss nanotech to upgrade their tech labs. Dominion Special Forces skins The Dominion Special Forces are available in StarCraft II as skins from the BlizzCon 2017 War Chest. A number of their skins are taken from the Covert Ops Crew. Dominion Special Forces building skins were introduced in the Katowice 2019 War Chest.

(more...) The StarCraft franchise is a series of real-time strategy (RTS) computer games developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It is similar to Blizzard's previous hit franchise Warcraft except that it has a space opera setting rather than a high fantasy setting. StarCraft was the best selling video game of 1998 and was so successful that Blizzard estimated in 2004 that 9.5 million copies had been sold since its release (4.5 million copies in South Korea) making it the third best-selling computer game in history. StarCraft is praised for being a benchmark of RTS for its depth intensity and balanced races. The main storyline of the series revolves around a war between three galactic species: the protoss (a race of humanoid religious warriors) the zerg (vile insect-like aliens who share a hive mind) and the terrans (initially descendants of human prisoners from Earth). The sequel StarCraft II is a trilogy with each ""chapter"" focusing on one of the three species. Welcome to the StarCraft Wiki! When adding references you must follow the referencing guidelines.

It is similar to Blizzard's previous hit Warcraft II except that it has a space opera setting as opposed to a high fantasy setting. StarCraft is praised for being a benchmark of RTS for its depth intensity and balanced races. The main storyline of the game revolves around a war between three galactic species: the protoss (a race of humanoid religious warriors) the zerg (vile insect-like aliens who share a hive mind) and the terrans (initially descendants of human prisoners from Earth). The storyline was initially introduced by the manual. It was initially released for Windows and later for Macintosh and Nintendo 64. The sequel StarCraft II was announced on May 19 2007 and the first chapter StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty was released on July 27 2010. A remastering named StarCraft: Remastered was announced for summer of 2017. With Patch 1.8 the game was made free to anyone with Battle.net. StarCraft was the best selling computer game in 1998 and won the Origins Award for Best Strategy Computer Game of 1998. In November of the same year Blizzard released an expansion pack called StarCraft: Brood War. StarCraft makes significant improvements over Warcraft II. WC II while advanced for its time featured what many gamers believed to be a weakness in that apart from a few minor (but significant for balance especially at higher skill levels) differences in available spells and the cost of upgrades the game's two races were exactly the same mechanically with only graphical differences. StarCraft improved upon this by adopting the technique introduced by Strategic Simulations' game War Wind of having sides with obvious asymmetries. The asymmetry was inspired in part by Magic: The Gathering. Though the game's three races (protoss terrans and zerg) were slightly imbalanced when the game was first released the expansion pack and fifteen patches (of which four significantly affected the game play mechanics) have balanced the three races. The game also includes multiplayer gaming on Blizzard's own Internet gaming service Battle.net. One can play against opponents free of any charge beyond the original purchase of the game and local Internet access fees. Many fans enjoy playing in groups against the computer in skirmish games. While the AI is considered to be weak compared to a good player decent early game performance can make it an enjoyable opponent for more casual players. Fans are also able to create unfair maps that are advantageous to the computer and can be extremely hard to beat. A few years after the release of the game Blizzard also released several free maps of a higher difficulty. Over time the patches have also improved the AI. Blizzard produced one expansion pack for StarCraft in the form of StarCraft: Brood War released in November 1998. The expansion pack adds new units and continues the storyline in the form of a campaign structure similar to the original game. Blizzard authorized two expansion packs in the same year—Insurrection and Retribution. Both of these expansions are set during the events of the original game. As of 2010 Blizzard has not decided whether these are canon or not but would be willing to incorporate certain material from the games. Commercial expansion packs that were unauthorized by Blizzard include Stellar Forces HunCraft and Stratospace. In some cases these expansion packs have been removed from circulation and legal action taken. On March 26th 2017 a remastering of the StarCraft and Brood War was announced. It would feature new visuals audio and online support but the core gameplay is set to remain unchanged. StarCraft improved upon its predecessor Warcraft II which featured two very similar playable factions by introducing asymmetry between the units and technologies available to its three races (Protoss Terran and Zerg). This asymmetry was similar to that pioneered in the lesser-known 1996 SSI release War Wind. The unit types available to each race define its racial identity. The Protoss can field powerful and expensive warriors and machinery while the Zerg count on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm their opponents. The Terrans are the versatile and flexible alternative to both races with an emphasis on specialization and combined arms. In many ways the Terran can be considered the ""in-between"" race in that they tend to benefit from more moderate conditions whereas the other two races tend to prefer one extreme or the other. This can make it difficult to create maps that are fair for all races. The trifecta The plot of the original StarCraft game revolves around the arrival of the zerg in the Koprulu sector and their later invasion of the protoss home world Aiur. After they have destroyed the Confederate colony on Chau Sara the zerg are used by the rebel organization Sons of Korhal which lures them to a number Confederate worlds using psi-emitters to further their own goals. After the Confederacy's fall the Sons of Korhal's leader Arcturus Mengsk establishes the Terran Dominion crowning himself emperor. The Zerg Swarm is however closely followed by a protoss fleet which burns down all worlds the zerg infest. The leader of the Protoss task force High Templar Tassadar later discovers that he can disrupt the Overmind's control over the Swarm by eliminating his cerebrate servants with the help of the Dark Templar. The involvement of the fallen Dark Templar will prove to be fateful; indeed while slaying the Cerebrate Zasz the Dark Templar Zeratul briefly comes in psychic contact with the zerg Overmind who is then informed of Aiur's location and directs his Swarm towards the protoss world. The protoss high authority the Conclave is defeated by the Swarm along with a large proportion of all protoss. In a desperate attempt to put an end to the zerg's destruction Tassadar Zeratul and the remaining protoss unite their strengths with human Jim Raynor and attack the Overmind itself. They succeed in destroying it because Tassadar sacrifices himself to destroy it using Dark Templar energy. StarCraft has achieved a cult-like status in the computer gaming world. Due to the complexity and depth of the strategic possibilities StarCraft especially in its online multiplayer form remains very popular even years after its original release. The game's popularity in South Korea has been unexpectedly high with nationally recognized tournaments and intense training groups sprouting up across the country. There are even a couple of cable-access channels that often televise tournaments live with the top players competing against each other cheered on by enthusiastic spectators and fans. The top StarCraft players enjoy mild celebrity status. Even as of 2005 StarCraft is still one of the most popular online games in the world. The game itself has its own culture similar to Slashdot's and Massive Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) communities. Also of note is the infamous Operation CWAL (Can't Wait Any Longer). Operation CWAL formed in 1997 as a writers group in the StarCraft Suggestions Forum in an attempt to ""liberate"" a final copy of StarCraft which appeared obviously completed despite numerous delays on the part of Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard Entertainment has gone as far as to give special thanks to this group in the manual for StarCraft as well as including their name as a cheat code in the game (typing ""operation cwal"" during a single player game will dramatically decrease the time required to build units). While not very active today Operation CWAL remains as one of Blizzard Entertainment's older and more loyal fan groups. In the early 2000s the game became extremely popular among South Korean online gamers to the point of being exaggeratedly referred to as the national sport of South Korea by avid gamers and the majority of StarCraft players now come from that country. The origin of this unusually high level of popularity is likely a combination of StarCrafts suitability for competitive multiplayer and the fact that it was released during the beginning of the boom in popularity of ""PC baangs"" in Seoul resulting in a perfect opportunity for the game to catch on. In South Korea StarCraft professional gamers known by their pseudonyms such as Lim_Yo-Hwan aka SlayerS_`BoxeR` Iloveoov [Oops]Reach [ReD]NaDa [NC]...YellOw and Nal_rA are celebrities: their games are broadcast over the television channels MBC Game and Ongamenet. A selected few have made substantial monetary gains through this. For example one highly successful player ""[Red]Nada"" signed a 3-year $500000 contract in 2004. Another example is ""SlayerS_`BoxeR"" who can if all goes well make $780000 in the next 3 years making him the highest paid StarCraft player ever. Some players can earn a decent to good living from TV-contracts and sponsoring and tournament prizes. However the lower-echelon pro players tend to subsist on relatively small wages. Many pro gamers playing StarCraft use every minute of their spare time to play in order to maintain preparation for the highly competitive leagues. Superior StarCraft and Warcraft III players are often referred to as ""gosu"". Less than average skilled players are often called hasu. Professional gaming in South Korea is an example of how e-sports can attain a social status similar to physical sports. StarCraft enables the player to record a game and save it as a replay which can then be viewed with any other copy of StarCraft displaying the entire course of the game. As of 2005 there are many websites that host replays of players with different skill levels though pro-level replays are relatively rarely released for reasons of team secrecy and pro-league policy. The RWAtools are a set of freeware tools that create valid replay files additionally containing an Ogg audio stream. They allow gamers to comment their own games while they play them and comment replays of other players. During replay the commentary is kept in sync with the game. This can be particularly interesting for people new to the game who can learn from more experienced players pointing out things about a replay they would not have seen on their own or simply for entertainment. BWChart is a program used to analyze a player's actions in order to teach the viewer how a given player plays. Lasgo's Observer Pack contains beside other things a tool that allows you to see the results of the recorded player's actions as if you played yourself (except the mouse pointer and the selection boxes). VODs (from ""Video On Demand"") are videos that show the screen of a commentator (or sometimes player) during a (usually) pro-level game. They are (legally or not) available from a variety of websites and are ripped from Korean television or Internet streams. They usually come in the ASF video file format for Windows Media Player which plays them with seeking disabled or in the Windows Media Video format. Because they are compressed with an MPEG-4 codec and the file size needs to be small there is a significant quality loss in comparison to watching a replay. VODs are usually accompanied by enthusiastic announcing from the Korean commentators and the occasional crowd shot. The game comes with a campaign/map editor (practically a ""Game Creation System"" in itself) called StarEdit. StarEdit has many features including a trigger system that allows one to make radical changes to the way that map works readily giving gamers the ability to create custom map scenarios (also called MOD's). Hundreds of custom scenarios are created everyday giving the game a refreshing variety. The StarCraft map-making community has also constructed additional editors or functionalities that grant the user even more power to modify the game. Scenarios are created with entirely different sets of rules objectives and units. More popular user created scenarios include Evolves Golem Madness Turret Defense Sunken Defense Nightmare RPG and the ubiquitous Tower Defense. There is another type of map circulating in the online communities: StarCraft Diplomacy. There have been multiple versions of this game produced. The version was inspired by the board game Diplomacy. Maps set in the story lines of popular television shows are also widely used. Android Menace is a particularly developed example taking place in a large portion of the Dragon Ball Z story line. Maps with infinite minerals are also very popular examples including ""Fastest Map Ever"" and ""0Clutter."" Many real-world events including the Napoleonic Wars World War I World War II and the American Civil War have also been used as a base for StarCraft maps. There have been recent StarCraft maps depicting single or multiple scenes from books and movies such as Troy and The Lord of the Rings. These maps include The Battle for Pelennor Fields and The Battle for Helm's Deep. In addition a large amount of StarCraft players are also engaged in large multi-player ""Lord of the Rings""-type based maps with each player controlling and developing a whole nation complete with heroes and units. Instead of the building their forces from the ground up players are given control of pre-built cities and armies. Units are periodically created at a special point called the ""spawn point"". The purpose of these maps is usually to destroy a certain building that when destroyed disables an enemy's ability to spawn units. These maps range from the traditional Lord of the Rings v. Last Alliance (LA) to newer maps such as The Rings of Power (TRoP) and After Lord of the Rings (After-LotR). Older maps include Lord of the Rings version GOLD which many accept as the origination of the ""castle building"" idea and Middle Earth version Pre Lord of the Rings which introduced the concept of hero units that were dauntingly stronger than the units in a standard army shifting the focus of the game from large-scale battles to single unit strategy. This includes the strategy of operations or ""opping"" which involves using one hero unit to achieve a goal such as the destruction of an opponents spawn(s) or heroes The popularity of custom maps is not limited however to only online gaming. Because StarEdit allows the mapmaker to ""link together"" several maps single player ""campaigns"" (which are long scenarios played out over several maps hence the name ""campaign"") have become prominent in the community. Popularized by the revolutionary Antioch Chronicles many campaigns even come with ""MODs"" that feature new ""heroes"" (i.e. the mapmakers create new art files to be imported in to StarCraft thus creating completely new units and characters - something StarEdit alone could never do). Popular player-made campaigns include Campaign Creations' Legacy of the Confederation Life of a Marine The Antioch Chronicles and StarCraft.org's official campaigns: The Shifters and Fields of Ash. In addition some other map editors exist. These include the ""StarCraft X-tra Editor"" and have other features not in StarEdit. One of the possibilities included in some editors include ""stacking"" buildings and minerals placing many one on top of the other. The ability to change player colors has been left to some of the more advanced editors including ""SCMDraft"" and ""StarForge"" which were introduced after editors such as ""GUEdit"" and SCMToolkit"" were becoming obsolete after barriers were broken and newer limits set. Most serious map creators now prefer ""SCMDraft2"" ""StarForge"" ""PROEdit"" and ""uBeR@TiOn"" because they give the user in-depth capabilities such as the ability to use hidden AI scripts protect maps from common theft running sizeless sounds directly from the StarCraft disc changing the color of text compressing their map and in more advanced areas place raw sprites sprite-units extended players disabled units etcetera. Most of these editors (excluding ""StarCraft X-tra Editor"") are designed from scratch eliminating most of the limits of the original StarEdit the ""StarCraft Campaign Editor."" Many of these 3rd party programs have revolutionized StarCraft map making and new discoveries as to what different sprites or unit numbers do to the game or as the most effective way to cloak certain units are discovered virtually every day. Many websites including StarCraft.org Staredit Network and StarCraft Index have been built around the capabilities of these impressive StarEdits. (src) - Bob Fitch(src) The concept for StarCraft game emerged after the completion of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness. While it was expected that Warcraft III would be the next logical step Blizzard's art team wanted to work on something different. Designers still wanted to make another RTS but it was decided that this time it would be in a sci-fi setting. Chris Metzen has voiced the opinion that the game was a reaction to the Warcraft series and as such from the outset was intended to be more gritty and realistic. The choice to go future sci-fi was at least partly influenced by the success of the Command and Conquer franchise which at the time utilized a modern military setting. The idea was that StarCraft would be an expansion set to Warcraft II—not in the literal sense but rather as branching out from the formula/mechanics already established. Much of the concept of the game revolved around the idea of three races and finding a balance between the three. At the time of the game's development Blizzard employed around 50 people; the StarCraft development team itself was composed of around twenty people. Numerous ideas were thrown around including the possibility of working with LucasArts to make a Star Wars-themed RTS. At some point the talks fell apart. Over time though it was developed into its own setting. The game received the name ""StarCraft."" Chris Metzen originally reacted negatively to the name due to its similar title with the Warcraft series. Walkers from Shattered Nations that would form the basis of goliaths Prior to/during the development of StarCraft Blizzard was working on at least two other sci-fi strategy games. One of these was Shattered Nations a post-apocalyptic game where factions had to scavenge technology. The game was canceled in favor of StarCraft but there is evidence that some aspects of Shattered Nations made it into its successor—the goliath design for instance bears great resemblance to a mech that was in Shattered Nations and was relabeled as such by gaming magazine PC Champ. Unlike StarCraft Shattered Nations was a turn-based isometric game similar to the Civilization games (though has also been compared to XCOM). Shattered Nations was cancelled in 1995 mere months after being announced. The team members were regrouped to quickly work on a new project with a 1996 release date. The game's art style would go on to influence that of StarCraft being more gritty than the previous Warcraft games. Another sci-fi RTS Blizzard worked on was Pax Imperia II a sequel to Pax Imperia. In 1997 Blizzard sold the rights to THQ and the proposed sequel was released as Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain. It has been stated however that StarCraft was a single project game. - Samwise Didier(src) StarCraft ended up having three races—terrans protoss and zerg. The terrans were the first and easiest race to develop while the zerg were fleshed out late in development. Each race had a single unit that would serve as the humping off point for the rest of the faction. These were the marine (terran) hydralisk and dragoon. A set of general guidelines for the three races was quickly settled on. Terran structures would be square and clunky protoss would have elegant and round structures while zerg structures would be vaguely triangular covered in spikes. The models of units were rendered out to tiny images at each of the angles. However Blizzard's cinematics team began production on the game long before the rest of it had been solidified. This led some confusion as to how units would appear in cinematics versus how they might appear in the game engine. In 1995 Blizzard contracted the development of Warcraft II's expansion Beyond the Dark Portal to Cyberlore Studios so that they could focus their own team on StarCraft. However during a milestone check-in with Cyberlore however Blizzard’s managers had deemed the work sub-par. They cancelled the contract and finished the add-on pack themselves. The experience soured Blizzard to outsourcing work to outside developers. The announcement of StarCraft came before the development of its game engine. The game was originally planned as a one year project. It was originally anticipated that the game would be shipped in December 1996 with the thought of the game being a one year development cycle Blizzard didn't want a long gap between releases—Warcraft I had been released in 1994 Warcraft II in 1995 and StarCraft in 1996. While some have commented that the idea of a one year development cycle seems ludicrous in hindsight Allen Adham was under pressure to continue growing Blizzard's revenue. In things turned out StarCraft was released in March 1998. Per its sci-fi setting the developers shifted away from the greens and browns of Warcraft and initially went for ""putrid pinks bright blues and garish greens."" At E3 1996 the game got a poor reception earning its ""orcs in space"" moniker due to its similarities with Warcraft II. According to Samwise Didier the reason for this was that work hadn't yet begun in earnest and the showing was the result of tight deadlines. After E3 the team set out to overhaul the game. At E3 the developers saw another sci-fi RTS called Dominion and felt that its 3D art style would be a good template for how a sci-fi RTS should look. For a while though StarCraft took the back seat to development of Diablo members of the development team were temporarily shifted to work on the game. Over the next two months Bob Fitch overhauled StarCraft's game engine while its members were steadily transferred to Diablo . The original game engine had been the same one as Warcraft II but it didn't generate the effects that Blizzard was looking for such as burrowing cloaking and the carrier's interceptors. All of Blizzard ended up working on Diablo prior to the game's release and its positive reception led Blizzard to re-evaluate its existing projects including StarCraft. Diablo had made the Warcraft II engine seem outdated. Work on the game restarted in January 1997 after Diablo's release. By this point Fitch had rewritten the game's engine. This afforded the developers more opportunities than the old Warcraft engine but it made the artwork AI and pathfinding harder. It was also at this point that the old ""orcs in space"" concept was ditched. Also in this period came the idea of rock-paper-scissors idea for the factions. Warcraft II had previously used mostly symmetrical factions. Likewise the team had noted that while the Command and Conquer series had shifted away from the Dune II paradigm of identical factions the differences between GDI and Nod were still minimal. Thus Blizzard wanted to try something different going for three races. Four were considered but this was decided against due to limited people time and the risk that four races could spread out the developers' ideas too much. Diablo had a knock-on effect due to its financial and critical success. StarCraft would be the first Blizzard game to embrace the company's philosophy of not releasing games until they were ready. The game was effectively rebooted. On one hand given the success of Diablo and Warcraft Blizzard were no longer underdogs in the PC gaming landscape. On the other in 1997 there were over eighty RTS titles in development. The developers knew that whatever they made would have to stand out. The team hoped that the ""tech reboot"" of StarCraft would only take a few months and that the full game would be released in summer 1997. This didn't occur. The game's ""crunch period"" began in August 1997. It lasted about six months before the game shipped in April 1998. According to some sources the game's ""crunch period"" drew development from Nomad (another Blizzard game though others state that work on Nomad began after StarCraft. StarCraft crashed frequently during development right up until release. A problem during development was that at this point in time game studios were starting to utilize 3D graphics while Blizzard still hand-drew their models. The game's artists began experimenting with 3D but at least at first the results were less than promising. To deal with the problem the art team made the models wider and thicker resulting in a distinctive over-the-top style. Another problem was that other studios were getting into 3D graphics and Blizzard still hand-drew their models pixel by pixel. Didier and the other artists began experimenting with 3D—though the results at least at first were less than promising. To deal with the problem the art team made the models wider and thicker resulting in a distinctive over-the-top style. This concept stemmed back to Warcraft to go against photorealism. For StarCraft this translated into a clunky aesthetic. This was the beginning of the ""Blizzard Style"" taken from technical necessity. On a related note the game could only feature 15 colors per model. The designers ended up making all the units in 3D before rendering them out as sprites. The art style of the game was intended to give the setting a definitive look. It was decided that the game's art style would be less cartoony and styalized than Warcraft but not as realistic in scale as Diablo. The game fell (and still falls) between the above-mentioned IPs delivering ""a blend of epic proportions somewhat grounded in realism""). Rob McNaughton has stated that the influences for the game's artstyle came from 70s/80s films and comics. - Glenn Stafford(src) The game's soundtrack was composed by Glenn Stafford. A suite of external synthesizers and outboard hardware utilizing more traditional recording techniques were used in the game's composition. The terran soundtracks extensively used slide distortion and electronic guitar. Stafford would later describe this as a ""homecoming"" for himself as his background lay in progressive rock whereas the music of Warcraft II was more orchestral. Country and rock were influences for the terran OST with the question being how country and rock wound exist in a setting where humanity had achieved interstellar travel. The protoss OST was designed to be ""deep powerful and cerebral."" It was more orchestral than the terrans and Stafford focused on instrumentation that would keep them feeling extremely distinct from Warcraft taking inspiration from Jerry Goldsmith's score to the movie Alien. Wary of parallel development he purposefully avoided the film Starship Troopers. For the zerg Stafford went for ambient electronic music ominous and dark with expansive sounds. The zerg OST was co-produced by Derek Duke. The zerg OST has been described as being ""future and retro at the same time. Earthy and organic yet laced with the strange and otherworldly drawing on evolution and advanced bio-technologies."" Many of the units in the game were voiced by Blizzard employees but were ""tweaked beyond recognition"" in the recording process. Voice and mouth sounds like whispers hisses and breathing were a big contributor to creating source material to be processed into various strange effects sweeteners ambiences and even in the music. During the development process there were great efforts to steer the game away from being simply ""Warcraft in Space"" and eventually the entire game engine had to be rewritten to allow the developers to achieve the desired result. Unlike Warcraft where both the Alliance and Horde played identically bar spells it was intended that StarCraft possess a rock/paper/scissors style of balance partially inspired by Magic: The Gathering. The game's resource system was finalized four months before the game's release. - Samwise Didier(src) The old ""space vampire"" concept The initial storyline of StarCraft was in a sense a science fiction spin-off of its counterpart franchise Warcraft. More of an action shooter it featured clans of 'space vampires' in a sci-fi setting. Concepts for the setting were worked on by Chris Metzen and Nick Carpenter. The original pitch was a science-fantasy epic with ""a story told in a far-out universe with a huge world and different factions."" Other members of the development team reacted negatively however. Metzen's work on the setting later led to the three races paradigm completely abandoning the original ""orcs in space"" concept. As design on StarCraft shifted towards an RTS game it was decided to simplify things into recognizable traits; spidery aliens and psychic brain aliens would be easily recognizable to an audience. Humans would feature in the game but the developers didn't want to do the ""Galactic Good Guys"" trope instead going with ""Surly Space Cowboys That Were Prisoners."" It was decided that the terrans would be ""rough and dirty"" the protoss ""primal and powerful"" and that the zerg would swarm their enemies. While the terrans were to represent ""the familiar"" the zerg would be monsters and the protoss the race possessing advanced technology and mysterious motives. Orcs were present during development with the idea of copying the set-up of the first Warcraft game Orcs and Humans. This idea was later abandoned. Influences for the game's setting came from Starship Troopers Predator and Battlestar Galactica. A promotional image from an early story blurb The terrans protoss and zerg made it to the final product but they differed from early conceptions. In early concepts for the game (which originally took place in the 28th century) the terrans had ruled the stars for 600 years but now possessed just a fragment of their early territory. The zerg (or ""zurg"" as they were originally known) were a bio-mechanical race rather than a purely organic one. The protoss were openly hostile to the terrans and in the game's original backstory carried out a massacre of terrans on one of the planets of Tau Ceti. A promotion closer to the game's release listed a story slightly closer to the final result but with differences. Here the Terran Confederacy was apparently the sole power within the Koprulu sector and experiencing resource and fuel shortages looked to the protoss worlds for new resources. At the same time the zerg were rampaging through protoss space destroying everything in their path. Initially the storyline was broad the key events such as the fall of the Terran Confederacy and the invasion of Aiur not being implemented until work began on the single player campaign. Cinematics were created before the fleshing out of the story designed so that they could easily fit in—the intro cinematic is an example of this designed to sell terrans as ""rednecks."" Characters and topics were almost chosen on a whim and were designed to be self-contained. At the time Blizzard looked at what other companies were doing with their cinematics and sought to go to ""the next level"" from Warcraft II. Only a handful of characters appear in the cinematics the main reason being that they didn't exist while they were being created. A recurring theme in the cinematics was the lack of a clear victory with triumph always coming at a cost with the price being paid by the ""poor bastards"" (terrans) being sent to the frontlines. During development Chris Metzen went back to the cinematics incorporating them into the campaign's flow. This led him to change some elements of the story so that they would better fit the cinematics. The exception to this was Tassadar's sacrifice at the end of the game which was specifically requested by the game's design team to be the game's finale. The game's characters were developed on the fly inserted into the story as required. For instance Jim Raynor was created so that the player would have a character they were invested in. However Raynor needed someone to talk to and thus Sarah Kerrigan was introduced. The terran campaign was written before the zerg campaign. In developing the latter the writers hit a snag as there were only a few sentient creatures in the Swarm and the Overmind ""was not exactly the charming sort."" The character issue was sorted by going back to the terran campaign and thinking about its consequences namely the ""death"" of Kerrigan at New Gettysburg. In the original version Kerrigan was ""dead-dead."" However the zerg campaign needed a character players could get invested in so the discussion returned to Kerrigan the idea of her not only being captured by the zerg but becoming their queen. How would she interact with her former friends and allies? In the words of Chris Metzen ""it felt so crazy we couldn't help but run with it."" When developing the game's zerg campaign Metzen gave the campaign ""a Shakespeare meets Old Testament kind of vibe."" The decision to make Kerrigan the Queen of Blades was to allow the zerg campaign to be seen through a human lens thus her infestation at the end of the terran campaign. The protoss campaign is the third and final campaign of the game's storyline. In terms of structure the first two campaigns are part of a story direction that reaches climax with the protoss as the player gets to see the downfall of the Protoss Empire. Certain elements of the canceled Blizzard game Bloodlines were ported into StarCraft though others (such as its space vampire concept) were cut. StarCraft sold well which Blizzard was prepared for. What wasn't expected was the reception in South Korea. It was the first Blizzard game to begin pushing the company in a global direction. StarCraft was the best selling computer and video game of 1998. An estimated 9.5 million copies were sold (4.5 million copies in South Korea) by 2004. In 2009 the Guinness Book of World Records recognized StarCraft as the best-selling RTS game at 9.5 million copies sold. StarCraft on the Walk of Game. StarCraft has been nominated for GameFAQ's 10 best games ever and Sony's Walk of Game. Guinness World Records awarded StarCraft the records for ""best selling strategy game for PC"" and ""longest-serving eSports game"" on 1 November 2010.

https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/StarCraft_version_history,Though Blizzard Entertainment released StarCraft as a finalized product like many other games it was far from perfect. Numerous exploits glitches and bugs were discovered but subsequently repaired by the release of patches. Whenever a patch is released it attempts to fix errors in the game but also adds implementations for the betterment of gameplay or user interface. Each patch released signifies a newer version of StarCraft and they are available either through Blizzard's Official Site Battle.net's gaming service or third party hosting sites. StarCraft's latest and current version is 1.22.0. Below is a list of versions and the changes they implemented.

It was developed by Blizzard Entertainment and Saffire Entertainment. Brood War was also incorporated into StarCraft 64. As of June 29 2009 StarCraft and Brood War combined have sold more than eleven million copies. With Patch 1.18 released in April 2017 the expansion and its base game were made free to anyone with Battle.net. This expansion provides three new campaigns two new units per race (3 for the protoss) plus some new tech advancements (e.g. Charon boosters an anti-air attack range upgrade for the goliath) new music tracks and new map tilesets (e.g. twilight tileset of the protoss world of Shakuras). The campaigns continue the story from where StarCraft left off: the Overmind has been destroyed with the sacrifice of Tassadar the protoss homeworld of Aiur has been left desolate and rampaged by the zerg and Sarah Kerrigan is left alone in her new form. The first of the new campaigns is the protoss one and mostly takes place on the Dark Templar homeworld of Shakuras. The second campaign (terran) features the newly arrived armies of the United Earth Directorate commanded by Admiral Gerard DuGalle and the last campaign (zerg) features Kerrigan as the protagonist. This is the protoss campaign of the StarCraft: Brood War game. Following Tassadar's sacrifice the zerg on the protoss homeworld fell into disarray but were still bent on their genocidal rampage. The zerg had split into two factions under the control of Daggoth and Kerrigan Protoss refugees under the leadership of Artanis and Zeratul retreated to the homeworld of the Dark Templar Shakuras despite protests from Aldaris. Raynor and Fenix went with them. The zerg followed. After arriving the protoss soon realized that two of their companions were gone. Mourning the loss of Raynor and Fenix they established a settlement dubbed New Antioch. They discovered Kerrigan after blowing up a zerg base. The protoss and Dark Templar reluctantly joined forces with Kerrigan after she explained that she was now free of the Overmind's control but that a new Overmind was growing on Char. Kerrigan asked for their help to kill it before it reached maturity and took control of Kerrigan's mind again. However the protoss asked for a favor in return. Two ancient crystals imbued with the powers of the Dark Templar and Templar Caste had to be recovered and be used to power the world's xel'naga temple to defeat the zerg on Shakuras. The two crystals were retrieved with Kerrigan's assistance. During the battles a massive terran fleet from the distant United Earth Directorate intervened while Aldaris troubled by their relations with the ""traitorous"" Dark Templar split off and declared war on Artanis' forces and the Dark Templar only to be defeated by Artanis and Zeratul but this was part of Kerrigan's plotting; she tricked the protoss into damaging Daggoth's zerg for her. The two crystals infused with the power of the two templars were then joined in a xel'naga temple. The two energies mixed and wiped out all zerg on the planet thus saving the protoss but also strengthening Kerrigan's position. This is the terran campaign of the StarCraft: Brood War game. The player character joined the United Earth Directorate Expeditionary Fleet assigned to subdue the terran worlds in this sector but their high-handed actions quickly make enemies of the various zerg and protoss factions as well. Their first enemy to fall was Mengsk's Dominion and later they also gained telepathic control of the local zerg. Kerrigan convinced Raynor to rescue Mengsk. Though divided by a zerg spy Samir Duran the UED succeeded in capturing and enslaving the new Overmind gaining control of many zerg forces. This is the zerg campaign of the StarCraft: Brood War game. With the massive UED fleet controlling increasing numbers of zerg Kerrigan was severely threatened. Painting herself as a victim and the combined zerg-UED as the greater enemy (as well as the judicious use of threats and hostages) Kerrigan gained the reluctant assistance of the scattered terran protoss and Dark Templar forces. As the UED was beaten back however she turned on each of her ""allies"" one by one. The new Overmind was killed and Kerrigan gained control of all the zerg. In this campaign Duran was an ally and consort of Kerrigan though it was revealed in the secret mission ""Dark Origin"" that he ultimately served a greater unaligned power. It was also revealed that he has made many zerg-protoss hybrids. These hybrids their true nature unknown play a large role in StarCraft II. In addition Brood War features a downloadable campaign called Enslavers: Dark Vengeance and is associated with a trio of secret missions: Deception Mercenaries II and Resurrection IV the latter only available in StarCraft 64. In StarCraft: Brood War each race has new units that change how the game flows. The terrans get the Valkyrie (air-to-air unit with large attack radius firing four groupings of two missiles that then acquire their own targets from any non-allied unit in range) and the medic (infantry support unit). The zerg get the devourer (air-to-air unit evolved from mutalisk with a very low rate of fire that can inflict a status ailment) and the lurker (ground-to-ground unit evolved from hydralisk that attacks while burrowed and has a line-splash attack). The protoss get the dark templar (similar to the dark templar hero but does slightly less damage and can transform into the dark archon); dark archon (a spellcaster that is capable of causing enemy units to join your force); and the corsair (air-to-air splash unit that fires quickly and has the ability to pacify ground units and defensive structures). The terrans and protoss gain a spellcaster each. Brood War and its base game were remade in StarCraft: Remastered which features updated visuals audio updates and support features but maintains the same base gameplay. Brood War was announced after the release of StarCraft's first two expansion packs Insurrection and Retribution. Sources differ on when development began on the game; a GameSpot feature states that development began after the release of the original game while The Cinematic Art of StarCraft states that development began prior to the release of the original game. Most of the team at Blizzard Entertainment responsible for StarCraft returned to work on Brood War. They were assisted by members of Saffire Entertainment who were contracted for a variety of tasks comprising of programming and design for levels visuals and audio effects. Bob Fitch has likened Brood War as being a ""balance patch"" for the base game. The team started to design and build units to specifically serve as counters or to simply shore up specific races' weakness. According to producer Shane Dabiri Brood War aimed to drastically increase the significance of the story within gameplay stating that the team were adding scripting that would allow ""Final Fantasy type events"" to be played out during the course of a level. Dabiri further explained that the objectives in the missions would also reflect the story in a far more interactive way with players being presented with tactical decisions over which objectives to pursue and with fewer missions revolving around simple annihilation of the enemy. Cinematics were designed differently than in the original game where the cinematics team developed stand-alone cinematics focused on tone. In Brood War the cinematics were developed in conjunction with the plot. Kerrigan was elevated to be the central antagonist for the game expanding her role from the original StarCraft. The United Earth Directorate was developed in mind with the idea of further expanding on Earth and its powers down the line but this plot thread was dropped in StarCraft II. The events of StarCraft: Brood War had little impact on StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty because the impact was mainly on characters. Little changed in the political situation with the biggest one the arrival of the United Earth Directorate fleet reversed by the end. This page uses content from the English Wikipedia.

It is set to be released as a trilogy. StarCraft II is free to play; multiplayer and the Wings of Liberty campaign are free and all Co-op Commanders free until level 5. Internet access is not required to play the game but is required for installation. StarCraft II is available through digital distribution. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty sold 1.5 million copies in its first two days and 3 million copies in its first month. It was the best-selling game of July 2010. Blizzard intends to continue support StarCraft II years after release in a similar manner to the StarCraft patches which have been updated more than ten years after the release of the original StarCraft. As of 2011 there are no plans to port StarCraft II to any console platform. The game is split into three separate self-contained installment products. The StarCraft II Trilogy Blizzard Entertainment chose this route due to the challenges they faced creating the campaigns. Through a trilogy they can create more content per campaign such as movies sets props characters missions (including Easter egg missions) and so forth. Each character has their own arcs missions and dialog. The story has been designed so that no previous knowledge of StarCraft is required to enjoy it. In-universe the campaigns occur in sequence each campaign beginning immediately after its predecessor. Each campaign has 26-30 missions in total (including branching missions) and a set ending rather than a cliff-hanger. All three races were completely developed for the multiplayer skirmish mode. Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void are considered to be expansion sets and are priced as such. Rob Pardo later described them as expansions from a multiplayer standpoint (much like Brood War) but sequels from a campaign standpoint. As of the announcement of the release date of Heart of the Swarm the cost of the first expansion is $40 USD for the standard edition and $55 USD for the deluxe edition. Each upgrades and expand multiplayer content in addition to containing a campaign such as the possibility of new units abilities and structures. New units available in the expansions can only be accessed if a player buys the expansion. Each product has upgrades to the multiplayer ""that's the whole point of the expansion or the second part"". Each race has been enhanced in some way. It was stated that StarCraft II would continue to receive downloadable campaign content post-Legacy of the Void in the form of ""mission packs"". The first of these Nova Covert Ops is a series of 9 missions released over a trio of installments. The first three missions were released on March 29 2016 and the second three on August 2 2016. After the release of the final part of the mission pack fan reaction will be gauged to determine whether more mission packs will be released or whether Blizzard should work on a new RTS game. At Gamescon 2016 Blizzard stated that they have no plans for additional mission packs moving into 2017. As of BlizzCon 2016 they are not working on any more mission packs. The reason for the shift was that there were observable spikes in Co-op Missions and Versus in terms of player engagement hence the shift to cultivate these modes. Blizzard is not currently working on any new campaigns (as of BlizzCon 2017). - Arcturus Mengsk on current events.(src) The trilogy takes place four years after StarCraft: Brood War. The storyline was written by Chris Metzen and Andy Chambers concurrently with The Dark Templar Saga which was written by Christie Golden. Each of the three campaigns – terran (Wings of Liberty) zerg (Heart of the Swarm) and protoss (Legacy of the Void) – has been released as separate products. The trilogy has an overall arc of escalation beginning small with Wings of Liberty (rebellion against the Dominion) escalating to Heart of the Swarm (where Kerrigan commands the fate of an entire race) and culminating in Legacy of the Void in the final battle of the Protoss against Amon. StarCraft II takes place both on new worlds and on worlds that appeared in the original game. Char is back as is Mar Sara. One of the new worlds is Bel'Shir a jungle-covered protoss-colonized moon that was a religious retreat until it was attacked by the zerg; it now houses many ruined temples. Other new worlds include Redstone III and Monlyth. Jim Raynor continues his adventures along with Kerrigan Zeratul and Artanis. The campaign can be played without an internet connection although Blizzard prefers that it be played online (to enable achievements and special save game features). An overarching thread involving the xel'naga and rumors of hybrid creatures weaves through the campaigns. There are many connections between the StarCraft: Ghost franchise and StarCraft II. For instance Gabriel Tosh a character from StarCraft: Ghost Academy appears on the Hyperion in Wings of Liberty and serves as a connection between the two storylines. The StarCraft: Ghost storyline especially parts revolving around the Terran Dominion acted as a building block for StarCraft II. The xel'naga fits into the story ""in a rather epic tale"" and form part of the backbone of the trilogy. The trifecta StarCraft II only features the three original races in standard multiplayer: protoss terran and zerg. It has been confirmed that there would not been a fourth race introduced. Some units have animations such as air banking starting and stopping. StarCraft II retains some units from the original game although some of these units have been given new abilities. Due to story events from the previous game some units have been phased out or replaced. For example the conquest of the protoss homeworld of Aiur has prevented the creation of more dragoons – the transplanted forms of protoss warriors in exoskeletons – resulting in the remaining dragoons to be redesigned with different weaponry and a shield that absorbs heavy damage and renamed to ""immortals"". The number of units in the game did not significantly change from Brood War. For every new unit added one ""underused"" unit has been removed. Early screenshot of StarCraft II gameplay The StarCraft II experience places emphasis on three playable races locked in a cinematic intra-galactic warfare through an epic story Campaign best-in-class multiplayer Versus competition and collaborative Co-op Missions. There are six levels of AI script difficulty: very easy easy medium hard very hard and insane. The insane AI mode is the only one which ""cheats"". StarCraft II features 20 unique tilesets including the Shattered City environment. Custom games allow ""handicaps"" for different players. This is set before the match. Custom games give players the ability to play against chosen players or AI on the maps of their choosing. These custom maps allow players to set map type game speed AI difficulty and expansion level. AI can be customized to favor different builds and strategies. Mods may be added to these custom maps to change the game experience while still giving the player the ability to play on different maps. Collections allow players to customize their battle.net profile and race's army. From here players can change their unit's skins their consoles announcers portraits decals and sprays. This menu also gives players the option to see what emoticons and /dance animations they have unlocked. For 3v3 and 4v4 games only four skins can be set per race. This can be set in the ""Large Format Games"" box. Replays are available in StarCraft II as well for both singleplayer and multiplayer games. Multiplayer games include menus leaderboards and overlays displaying statistics. StarCraft II features seven observer modes: These are available in ""real time"". In Observer Mode a viewer can watch in the ""old style"" or in a newer ""first person view"" in which they see the camera view selections and commands issued from the player's viewpoint. An observer won't be able to see the actual mouse clicks however. At the end of the game build orders an army graph showing the size of the army over time and a resource graph showing income over time can be displayed. Blizzard Entertainment released a new version of battle.net with StarCraft II. Frank Pearce said they wouldn't be able to implement all plans by the time StarCraft II launches but they can add more features to battle.net ""as we go"". StarCraft II does not have LAN support. Internet access is not be required to play the game but is required for installation. Blizzard expects requiring internet access for some features to not be a problem since computers come standard with internet connections now (unlike when StarCraft came out). Players of StarCraft II and Diablo III share ""gamer achievements"" adding up to a Blizzard Level in a similar manner to the system in World of Warcraft. While achievements can be accessed in the single-player game this is only possible if the gamer is connected to battle.net. Players does not require internet access to play single-player games but they are encouraged to do so. The game did not launch with the ability to display replays to multiple users. Blizzard intends to train new players for the multiplayer game eventually transforming casual gamers into hardcore gamers. The campaign does not act as a tutorial for teaching game mechanics. Instead the game includes pre-recorded tutorials which players can watch as well as ""challenges"" small missions which train players in specific tasks suited for multi-players games such as efficient resource gathering. A challenge would last 5-10 minutes and the player would get a score. Challenges cover topics important to multiplayer such as resourcing hotkeys and counters. In addition players receives help on why they won or lost a game. There are tutorials for protoss and zerg which players can view before playing them on battle.net. Blizzard expected players who start on Battle.net to play cooperatively vs the AI then move into team play before finally graduating to 1 vs 1. Blizzard considers team play less hectic as the teammates can support each other. Achievements are used to direct players along this path. Blizzard expects players to play 30-60 hours of the game before they begin playing 1 vs 1. By 2012 Blizzard changed its training techniques. As of patch 2.0.4 StarCraft II comes with a training mode. The training mode shows four windows going left to right—Training Versus A.I. Unranked and Ranked. Each race has three training missions. For each there are three stages. The player is given simple goals against an AI opponent. Stage 1 goes at normal speed and gives ground units. Stage 2 gives more advanced ground units and increases the game speed to fast. At stage 3 all units are available and the speed is set to faster. The player can then play against the AI either singly or in groups. A matchmaking vs AI system has been introduced where players matches against an AI level that matches their skills. This is called the AI Challenge Mode. This is determined by three placement matches. Next is Unranked Play which do not affect a player's ladder ranking. Matchmaking is still be used to pair off players. The game uses the ranked ladder rating if the player already has one but it begins to diverge at this point. Finally there is the traditional Ranked Play. This gives access to the ladder and leagues. Leagues are part of the tool system making multiplayer StarCraft II available for all skill levels along with the automated matchmaking system. There are copper bronze silver gold platinum and diamond leagues. There is also a ""safer"" Practice League which would involve players of lower skill levels playing on maps designed to prevent rushing at ""normal"" rather than a faster game speed. Blizzard intends to take steps to prevent ""smurfing"" when higher-skilled players participate in battle.net games they shouldn't be and disrupt other players. StarCraft II features new soundtracks by Glenn Stafford the soundtrack composer for StarCraft. In addition edited versions of the StarCraft soundtracks are found in StarCraft II. The trilogy's lore lore is supported by several novels authorized by Blizzard Entertainment. The Dark Templar Saga serves as a prologue to StarCraft II I Mengsk is a tie-in to StarCraft II and the StarCraft: Ghost novel Spectres also served as a tie-in. This article or section contains information from the optional Covert Missions in StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Nova and Gabriel Tosh the latter introduced in the Ghost Academy graphic novel series feature in a subset of missions centered around spectres. Tosh hires Jim Raynor to collect jorium and terrazine to assist in the production of spectres and the player may ultimately either side with Tosh and break Tosh's fellow spectres out of New Folsom Prison or side with Nova to kill Tosh and destroy his spectre production facilities. The player receives the ability to use either spectres or ghosts depending on who they side with. Horace Warfield also factors prominently into the later stages of the campaign being the general accompanying Valerian Mengsk. However there is no mention of his connection to Nova or spectres. The following section contains information from a previous version of StarCraft II which is no longer valid. A Nova-centered cinematic appears on a TV screen in StarCraft II. Certain assets from StarCraft: Ghost such as interior installation art appear in StarCraft II. StarCraft II supports the DirectX 9 (Pixel Shader 2.0) software. It is fully compatible with DirectX 10 as well which provides access to enhanced graphical effects. The game is also compatible with DirectX 11 but it don't support features specific to it. The Mac client utilizes OpenGL instead. The game also features the Havok physics engine allowing realistic interaction with the environment such as ""debris roll(ing) down a ramp"". The game supports a variety of video cards; old cards like ATI Radeon 9800/NVIDIA GeForce FX to ATI Radeon HD 4800s and NVIDIA GeForce G200s are also supported. StarCraft II supports screen resolutions from 5:4 to 16:9. Wider screens has a slightly larger viewable range. The game supports wide screens but not multiple monitors. The minimum resolution is 1024 x 768 x 32 bits. StarCraft II supports a windowed mode. Game unit models feature about 2000 polygons. During game design 3DSMax was used to create low-polygon unit models MudBox for high-polygon models and Photoshop was used to edit textures. Gore can be disabled but doing so requires restarting the game. StarCraft II is written in 32-bit code but supports 64-bit systems. It has multi-core capability. The game supports lighting effects including a light/dark cycle used in some missions. Voice chat is enabled over battle.net but the audio is not available in replays. The game comes with a map editor. The StarCraft II Map Editor improves upon the World Editor from Warcraft III in every way. Blizzard supports the modding community with theirs Arcade program. There are plans to allow to sell some mods the future. Startools a proprietary toolset is included with Galaxy Map Editor. Startools lets modders design and create doodads. - Rob Pardo(src) - Chris Metzen (comment made in 2015)(src) Some discrepencies exist as to when development on StarCraft II began. Reportedly development on the game began shortly after Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne in July 2003. The game reportedly entered full production c. 2004 codenamed ""Medusa."" However The Cinematic Art of StarCraft states that the game only started to be discussed in 2005. The development was ramped up shortly after the production of World of Warcraft which was when Blizzard Entertainment hired Dustin Browder: March 14 2005 to the position of senior designer. He later became the lead designer. The conception was for a re-imagining of the original game having more units but staying true to its spirit. However the developers didn't want each race's unit count to get too big. It was decided that if a unit was brought back from the original another unit would have to be cut. Story was considered but the main focus was to remake the multiplayer of the original game in 3D. Blizzard designed the races around ""cool units"" rather than having specific plans for the races. The developers knew they had to create new units and buildings as well as provide new gameplay approaches for each race but also stay true to the setting's core mechanics. The game was designed specifically around competitive skill-based e-sports. Blizzard discussed the possibility of a fourth race early on in the game's development. However the development team felt that had a finite amount of ideas and wanted to make sure that they focused on the best ideas for the existing three playable races rather than diluting those ideas across four races. Over development the idea of bringing in a fourth race made ""less and less sense."" It has been indicated that the United Earth Directorate was considered for ""fourth power"" status within the game's framework. In August 2008 Frank Pearce stated that adding a fourth fully playable race would likely be discussed if Blizzard decided to make an expansion for the game three months before the expansions were announced. New technology was created to support the larger number of 3D units on-screen allowing artists and other designers to update vehicles buildings and pieces of scenery piece by piece. When development on the game began artwork from the original StarCraft was looked at. However very little source art from the original was preserved. The artists were given free reign to iterate on the original designs. The game's multiplayer was focused on with multiplayer in playable form before work began on the campaign. Multiplayer was fully playable by the time of the game's announcement. The game was updated approximately once a week during development. Addressing rumors Karune stated that StarCraft II was intended to be released before Diablo III. Blizzard made the very first publicly playable demo of StarCraft II available at BlizzCon 2007. StarCraft II was featured at E3 2007 July 11 2007. Only a demo was viewable not a playable version. StarCraft II was featured at BlizzCon 2007 August 3 to 4 2007. Terrans and Protoss were playable. The same two races were playable at GenCon Indy. The game was available at the 2007 Games Convention in Leipzig Germany August 22 to 26 2007. The game was still in internal alpha/pre-alpha in August 2008. Two weeks before BlizzCon 2008 the entire company played StarCraft II an important milestone. The exposition match played at BlizzCon 2008 was referred to as an ""alpha"" version but also a ""pre-alpha"" version and in Battle Report II it was referred to as an alpha version. Mike Morhaime expected the game to launch by the end of 2009 but this has been delayed to at least 2010 to give adequate time to prepare Battle.net. A StarCraft II beta key was released at BlizzCon 2008. In February 2009 Blizzard COO Chris Sams said the beta was ""months away"". That same month Dustin Browder addressed criticisms that the beta was taking too long to announce saying they Blizzard still needed to do work on the campaign and on battle.net and that the beta would be announced when they had an idea what the release date would be. He also believed the beta would be announced in 2009. In August 2009 Blizzard announced that StarCraft II would not be released in 2009 and would instead be released in the first half of 2010. The StarCraft II beta was announced in February 2010 and released on the 17th of that month. The beta closed on July 19. It had a day one patch. As of August 2011 the ""Starter Edition"" became available. This gives access to the first three missions of Wings of Liberty plus either The Evacuation or Smash and Grab (player's choice) the first two challenges: Tactical Command and Covert Ops access to terrans in Single-Player vs AI and Custom Games in the following maps: Discord IV High Orbit The Shattered Temple Xel'Naga Caverns and the custom map StarJeweled subject to change over time. Achievements and campaign progress are saved in case the player upgrades to the full version of Wings of Liberty or any other chapter. StarCraft II adopted a free to play model in November 2017. It was anticipated that players new to the game would start with the campaign then transition to Co-op Missions then transition to Versus (under the premise that each transition would give the player a rise in difficulty). Analysis by Blizzard showed that this wasn't the case though and there was no overall pattern of player preference as far as transitions went. - Chris Metzen(src) The generalities of the overall story were present before the decision was made to extend it over a trilogy. The trilogy's arc was designed by Chris Metzen James Waugh and Jason Huck. The larger points were agreed on and were given to the design team. One of the aspirations was the game was to do something different from StarCraft I namely the briefing screen format. Metzen pushed for the game to be a ""living"" one. That the storyline was split over three games was a result of the sprawling narrative that was envisioned. The United Earth Directorate was originally going to play a significant role in the game where the conflict between the terrans zerg and protoss would spiral back to Earth where the zerg would invade. But as the campaign developed a number of things shifted and this plan got scaled back. Furthermore it was found that the conflict between the Terran Dominion and Raynor's Raiders was sufficient to define Wings of Liberty without the need to bring in the UED. The lead designer for StarCraft II was Dustin Browder. The team devoted to StarCraft II consisted of only about 40 developers in 2008 including twelve people who worked on the original StarCraft. As of 2008 the team consisted of four or five managers 12-14 programmers 8-10 artists and the rest consist of designers. It has its own internal leadership structure. A ""couple"" of ex-progamers are part of the team working on balance issues such as mutalisk micromanagement and creating strategies against each other. By June 2009 the team had expanded to about 50 members and by August it had expanded to 60 members. As of September 2009 StarCraft II has 58 unique voice actors. Some play more than one role.

https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_StarCraft_II_units,The protoss stalker The following is a complete unit list for StarCraft II multiplayer game units to date. StarCraft II was announced on May 19 2007. The unit list has undergone numerous changes since then. StarCraft II was released as a trilogy. With each installment more units were released in a manner similar to the additional units added in StarCraft: Brood War. The first StarCraft II product Wings of Liberty was released on July 27 2010. Units added in Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void have been sub-divided from the base unit list. All three races are available in the Versus mode of StarCraft II. In StarCraft II terran add-ons the reactor and the tech lab work differently. Instead of being specific to an associated structure each add-on can be added to any barracks factory or starport granting a specific benefit. One structure may only have one add-on attached to it so it cannot benefit from the reactor's bonus and the tech lab's bonus simultaneously. StarCraft II has a number of campaign-specific units. Many can be controlled by the player. Some units that were cut in development will appear in the map editor and campaign. However units that were completely cut did not appear in either.
